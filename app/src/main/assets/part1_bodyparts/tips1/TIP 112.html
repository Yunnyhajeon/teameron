            A usually painless lump or swelling in your testicle with or without a small lump in the groin could be serious. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men. Most cases of testicular cancer are found between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four. However, they can occur later in life as well. Note: Testicular cancer is more commonly found in men whose testicle(s) did not naturally descend from the abdomen to the scrotum within the first year of life. On the other hand, swelling, severe pain, and/or tenderness of the testicle can be the signs of another serious condition requiring emergency   care.
