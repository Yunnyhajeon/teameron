            The loss of basic skills, such as walking and talking clearly, or the regression to behavior such as thumb-sucking, "baby talk," bed-wetting, or wetting themselves is known as developmental regression. It has a number of serious causes and the affected child should be thoroughly evaluated.

            <p>
                Occasionally when a child has been ill or has had a major emotional upset—such as the arrival of a new brother or sister— he or she may temporarily lose recently acquired skills, such as potty-training. But a child who loses several skills progressively, especially if there is no obvious reason, should be evaluated by a physician. There are many possible causes, including brain disorders, a tumor, HIV infection, child abuse, a mental or learning disability, or autism.

            If you have a family history of crib death [also known as SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)], or an infant who has had "near-miss crib death," you can take some siple measures to dramatically reduce the risk of a recurrence.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                In developed countries, SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) or crib death is still the most common cause of death in babies age one month to one year. Most cases occur in babies under six months of age. The incidence has decreased dramatically since the public education campaigns of the early 1990s on the sleeping positions of babies.

            </p>

            <p>
                The following babies are especially at risk:
                <ul>
                    <li>Premature and low-birth-weight babies</li>
                    <li>Twins, triplets, etc. (multiple pregnancies)</li>
                    <li>Babies from a lower socioeconomic status</li>
                    <li>Babies in households where anyone smokes, especially the mother. This risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked; for every additional ten cigarettes per day, the risk of crib death increases threefold.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                In order to reduce your baby’s risk of crib death:
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not smoke during pregnancy, or permit anyone to smoke in your household after the birth of your baby.</li>
                    <li>Put your baby to sleep on his or her back. If the baby has reflux (a spitting baby), tilt the baby on his or her left side to prevent fluid from regurgitating into his or her lungs (aspiration). Once your baby is old enough to roll over, this is irrelevant.</li>
                    <li>Do not overdress your baby or use too much bedding, especially if the baby is already warm. Use only one thin blanket if needed. Tuck it in so it cannot cover the baby’s head. A blanket sleeper or warm sleeping garment is an alternative in a cold environment.</li>
                    <li>Never put your baby on a water bed, sheepskins, or very soft bedding material.</li>
                    <li>Select a crib that conforms to Consumer Product Safety Commission recommendations and has a firm and snug-fitting mattress.</li>
                    <li>Never leave stuffed animals in the crib while your baby is sleeping.</li>
                    <li>Breastfeed your baby for at least six months if possible (of course, there are other advantages of breast-feeding for six months or more).</li>
                    <li>If you think your baby is sick, contact your doctor.</li>
                    <li>Learn simple cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) methods. (See Appendix A.)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                A baby is generally diagnosed as having died of SIDS if no specific cause of death is found.

            Babies and young children can easily swallow a harmful medicine or a dangerous household item like bleach, batteries, etc. If your child does not talk yet, look for signs that they have been poisoned with a toxic substance. If you are in doubt, call your regional poison control center or the American Association of Poison Control Centers (1-800-222-1222) for advice.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If your child has swallowed a potentially dangerous substance, it may be obvious—he or she may tell you, or you may see him/her with the container. But your child could have swallowed a toxic substance unobserved. The following are some of the symptoms resulting from poisoning:
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
                    <li>Severe throat pain</li>
                    <li>Burns on the lips or mouth</li>
                    <li>Convulsions</li>
                    <li>Unconsciousness</li>
                    <li>Sudden unusual behavior, dizziness, weakness, or illnes</li>
                    <li>Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision, a change in pupil size</li>
                    <li>Loss of bowel or bladder control</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you suspect that your child has swallowed a toxic substance, do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stabilize your child. Check his or her breathing, and then resuscitate him/her if necessary (see Appendix A, page 350, for information about CPR). Place him/her in the recovery position (lying on the side with the mouth aimed toward the ground so that if your child vomits he or she will not choke). If the child is ill or not fully awake, call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
                    <li>Identify the substance and the amount that was swallowed. Search carefully for any suspect containers, and bring anything you find with you to the ER. If the swallowed substance was vitamin tablets with iron, for example, try to estimate the number missing from the container. If there are toxic chemicals on your child’s skin or eyes, remove the contaminated clothes and place them in a plastic bag so that you can bring them with you to the ER without further contaminating anyone. Wash the child thoroughly with plain water and get him or her to an emergency room right away.</li>
                    <li>If your child is stable, or even has no symptoms, but you know that he or she has ingested a potentially poisonous substance, you should still call your local poison control center (the number should be listed in your phone directory under emergency numbers) or the American Association of Poison Control Centers at 1-800-222-1222.</li>
                    <li>Do not induce vomiting. Induction of vomiting is no longer suggested in the management of accidental poisoning, because it can cause complications in the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach) or lungs.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you happen to witness your child swallowing a potentially harmful substance, do not wait for him or her to become ill. Seek advice immediately. Delay can be fatal! Remember, the best way to save your child’s life from poisoning is to not let him or her get near any toxic compounds. Store all your medicines and dangerous household items in a safe place.

            Teenagers, in particular, are more likely to abuse substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, ecstasy, methamphetamine, GHB, crystal meth, etc.). Inhaled substances such as adhesives, aerosols, solvents, and cleaning agents are especially dangerous, as they can cause brain, liver, and kidney damage, and sometimes even sudden death
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Substance abuse is more common in adolescent boys than girls. Tobacco is addictive and often causes death in later years, while alcohol is a major killer of both teenagers and adults. Inhalant use is prevalent among younger teens, and even in prepubescent kids. Inhalant abuse may be harder to detect in your child, because the “high” is only momentary and inhaled substances are found in every setting (homes, schools, stores, the workplace, etc.). The excessive use of household or office products that come in a spray can may be a tip-off that someone has an inhalant abuse problem. These might include products such as glues, spray paint, air fresheners, lighter fluid, oven cleaner, Dust-Off, or even dessert topping sprays. This is serious; even experimenting with inhalants can result in serious long-term physical or psychological problems, or even death.

                Watch out for changes in personality, mood, sleeping patterns, and/or appetite. Attempt to verify the facts, and contact self-help groups for advice. If you are unsure of whether your child is taking drugs, get professional help quickly. Lead your children by positive example, and spend time with them so that they will trust you and know that you accept them. A comprehensive resource is the National Institute on Drug Abuse  website: www.drugabuse.gov.
