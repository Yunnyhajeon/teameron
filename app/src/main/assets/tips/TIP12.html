            Fatigue, anxiety, and panic disorders may all be related to a medical condition known as depression, which is the most common of all psychiatric disorders. In its extreme form, depression can lead to thoughts about hurting oneself, or even suicide. You must know something about this disease in order to combat it. Effective medicine and psychotherapy are available to treat depression and related mood disorders, in combination with stress-relieving activities. There are also cutting-edge medical treatments such as deep brain stimulation surgery that have been very effective in certain situations.

                From the medical perspective, the term “depression” does not necessarily mean feeling “down and withdrawn.” Its symptoms may include fatigue, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and/or headaches. You may experience anxiety or a loss of interest in the things you normally enjoy. If you are elderly, your number-one symptom of depression might be a feeling that you are losing your memory. These feelings do not mean that you are crazy or a weak person. They may merely indicate that you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, or other biological factors such as a genetic predisposition for depression. They could also be related to environmental factors (poverty, stressful upbringing, etc.) or behavior patterns such as drug use or excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages.

                Certain areas of your brain have automatic centers that function without conscious thought to control the activities in your body, including your heart rate, changes in the size of your pupils or blood vessels, breathing, and sleeping. Normally when you experience an emotional event, these automatic centers create a specific spectrum of symptoms. For example, if someone frightens you, you may feel tightness in your throat, your muscles may become tense, and your heart rate may speed up. Other emotional challenges, like stress, may trigger one of your automatic brain centers such that you hyperventilate (rapid, deep breathing), have trouble sleeping, or experience headaches and an irritable stomach, all of which your brain will interpret as severe anxiety. These may sometimes be severe enough to be called “panic attacks.”

                If you have a chemical imbalance in one of the automatic centers in your brain, you may experience a variety of these symptoms without any emotional experiences to trigger them. For example, you may feel fatigued, as though you have been exhausted all day, even though you got enough sleep the night before. You may also feel anxious, with all of the organs of your body reflecting this anxiety, even though nothing has happened to make you anxious. Or you may feel depressed and withdrawn, without there being any reason for your anxiety. Note: A chemical imbalance can also result in bipolar disorder, wherein manic behavior cycles with depressed behavior.

                Many effective medications can help restore the chemical balance in your brain, alleviating these symptoms. Unfortunately many people who are suffering from chemical imbalances do not seek medical treatment.

                If you or a loved one have any of the symptoms of depression and have difficulty controlling them, make sure to seek help as soon as possible, because, in its most extreme form, this condition could turn suicidal. As such, it’s important to watch out for the risk factors for suicide, which are listed below.
