            Occasionally a skin infection will spread very rapidly, often causing red streaks or red, tender, swollen areas on the skin. The infection may also be associated with fever and feeling ill. It can be fatal.

                A wound that has become infected with germs is red and slightly swollen. Infected cuts or abrasions are common and, if kept clean, will usually improve within twenty-four hours. But if the redness of an infection spreads and there is more swelling and pain, watch out. Certain nasty germs, such as streptococci and staphylococci, can spread rapidly. Red streaks running up an arm or leg from the site of the infection indicate a rapid and dangerous spread of germs. If you have diabetes or are taking prednisone, you are especially vulnerable to these types of infections.

                If your infected wound is getting worse, consult your physician immediately. Your doctor can do tests to determine which antibiotic will be the most effective to combat the infection.
