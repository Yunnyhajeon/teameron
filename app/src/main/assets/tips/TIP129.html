            A rare abnormal opening between the bladder and colon or other organs can cause you to pass bubbles while you urinate. This can make it seem as if you have a sputtering urine stream, as if your urine is being fired out of a machine gun. This condition can be caused by scarring or cancer. It may lead to serious infections. There are  other causes of bubbles appearing in the urine, although in these cases, the urine appears foamy, like beer. It may be a side effect of a medication, or the result of a forceful urine stream or increased protein in the urine (proteinuria). Proteinuria can be found in people with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease.

                One of the most serious causes of “machine gun” urine flow is scarring or cancer resulting in connections (fistulas) between the bowel and the bladder. Also, these fistulas occur in persons with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. The bubbles are caused by gas in the bowels passing into the bladder. If you urinated in the bathtub, bubbles would come up. The urine is foul-smelling, with debris from the colon. Seek evaluation and treatment by a urologist (surgical kidney and bladder specialist) as soon as possible.
