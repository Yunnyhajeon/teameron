    <ul>
        <li>Most studies we reviewed suggested that the chest compressions are the most important part of CPR. However, breaths in combination with compressions are very important for children and infants.</li>
        <li>Try to do your best to follow the recommended CPR guidelines. However, the most important thing is to dive in and start CPR, even if you are unsure. If you don’t try, the person’s going to die.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
       Remember: <b>Time is of the essence.</b> Never delay or pause more than ten seconds when giving CPR. The ideal is to continue CPR until you revive the person or someone of equal or higher training takes over.

            <p>
                <b>Preparing for CPR</b>
                Do not move the person unless necessary, especially if you suspect a neck or spinal injury. If you must move the person and they are unresponsive, position them on their back, ideally on a hard, flat surface. Turn the victim’s entire body at once—head, shoulders, back, hips, and legs—in the same direction (log roll them) to protect the neck and prevent possible additional injuries. Avoid twisting the back. (Note: This is more easily done with two people.)
