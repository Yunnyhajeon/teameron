            Fatigue, anxiety, and panic disorders may all be related to a medical condition known as depression, which is the most common of all psychiatric disorders. In its extreme form, depression can lead to thoughts about hurting oneself, or even suicide. You must know something about this disease in order to combat it. Effective medicine and psychotherapy are available to treat depression and related mood disorders, in combination with stress-relieving activities. There are also cutting-edge medical treatments such as deep brain stimulation surgery that have been very effective in certain situations.

                From the medical perspective, the term “depression” does not necessarily mean feeling “down and withdrawn.” Its symptoms may include fatigue, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and/or headaches. You may experience anxiety or a loss of interest in the things you normally enjoy. If you are elderly, your number-one symptom of depression might be a feeling that you are losing your memory. These feelings do not mean that you are crazy or a weak person. They may merely indicate that you have a chemical imbalance in your brain, or other biological factors such as a genetic predisposition for depression. They could also be related to environmental factors (poverty, stressful upbringing, etc.) or behavior patterns such as drug use or excessive drinking of alcoholic beverages.

            <p>
                Certain areas of your brain have automatic centers that function without conscious thought to control the activities in your body, including your heart rate, changes in the size of your pupils or blood vessels, breathing, and sleeping. Normally when you experience an emotional event, these automatic centers create a specific spectrum of symptoms. For example, if someone frightens you, you may feel tightness in your throat, your muscles may become tense, and your heart rate may speed up. Other emotional challenges, like stress, may trigger one of your automatic brain centers such that you hyperventilate (rapid, deep breathing), have trouble sleeping, or experience headaches and an irritable stomach, all of which your brain will interpret as severe anxiety. These may sometimes be severe enough to be called “panic attacks.”
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a chemical imbalance in one of the automatic centers in your brain, you may experience a variety of these symptoms without any emotional experiences to trigger them. For example, you may feel fatigued, as though you have been exhausted all day, even though you got enough sleep the night before. You may also feel anxious, with all of the organs of your body reflecting this anxiety, even though nothing has happened to make you anxious. Or you may feel depressed and withdrawn, without there being any reason for your anxiety. Note: A chemical imbalance can also result in bipolar disorder, wherein manic behavior cycles with depressed behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many effective medications can help restore the chemical balance in your brain, alleviating these symptoms. Unfortunately many people who are suffering from chemical imbalances do not seek medical treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you or a loved one have any of the symptoms of depression and have difficulty controlling them, make sure to seek help as soon as possible, because, in its most extreme form, this condition could turn suicidal. As such, it’s important to watch out for the risk factors for suicide, which are listed below.
            </p>
            <p>
                RISK FACTORS FOR SUICIDE:
                <ul>
                    <li>Being male (although more girls attempt suicide, more boys actually succeed)</li>
                    <li>Chronic illness</li>
                    <li>Family history of suicide</li>
                    <li>Rural residence</li>
                    <li>White or Native American ethnicity</li>
                    <li>Advanced age</li>
                    <li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
                    <li>A gun in the house (firearms are the most common instruments of suicide in the United States</li>
                    <li>A previous suicide attempt</li>
                    <li>A traumatic experience: a death, a divorce, a failed exam, rejection by friends, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are having suicidal thoughts, there are several national phone numbers you can call to speak to someone immediately, including 1-800-273-TALK and 1-800-SUICIDE.

            You have survived a heart attack and you have every reason to be happy. Your cardiac rehab is progressing well, but you don’t feel like you want to do anything. Being around other people is a burden so you avoid them. What’s going on? Call your doctor and find out. You may be depressed. Depression is more common in heart attack victims and reportedly poses an additional health threat beyond its psychological ill-effects. Depression may contribute to the development of many potentially life-threatening medical conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                It has been clearly established from multiple scientific studies that patients’ outcomes following a heart attack can be adversely affected by depression (see Tip 12 for the symptoms of depression). There are changes in the body’s chemistry when depression occurs that can affect the automatic control mechanisms of the body’s vital organs. No one has determined how these changes reduce survival rates or increase the likelihood of heart attack complications, but there is overwhelming evidence that they do. Depressed heart attack patients are more likely to have a subsequent, fatal heart attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important for you to remember that there is no way to diagnose depression unless you discuss the condition with your doctor. Remember also that there are effective treatments for depression that may improve your odds of recovery.
            </p>

            <p>
                Patients often think they feel down because they have just had a heart attack. They do not realize that the depression itself could possibly increase their risk of dying from another heart attack. So when you’re feeling down after having a heart attack, talk it over with your doctor. It might save your life.

            Delirium, which is severe confusion and disorientation, means that something is wrong and is affecting the brain, which could be very serious.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Delirium is usually manifested by an altered state of consciousness consisting of confusion, distractibility, disorientation, and disordered thinking and memory. It often develops over short periods of time (within hours or days), as opposed to Alzheimer’s dementia, which may take several years to be recognized. It will generally fluctuate from hour to hour. The person may merely seem detached from their surroundings or they may begin to tremble and become agitated, or even have hallucinations and a complete loss of contact with reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many ailments can affect the brain, thereby causing delirium. They include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Infections (most commonly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or infections of the brain)</li>
                    <li>Side effects of medication</li>
                    <li>Abnormal chemical levels in the blood</li>
                    <li>Low oxygen levels</li>
                    <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Poisoning</li>
                    <li>Blockage of blood vessels going to the brain</li>
                    <li>Swelling of the brain from high blood pressure</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                When in a state of delirium, a person usually cannot reason, and therefore getting him or her to medical care may be difficult. He or she may be uncooperative and even combative. But this situation is urgent and requires immediate medical attention. Call for emergency assistance.

            Dementia, or the loss of memory and the ability to recognize things in senior citizens, is not always due to Alzheimer’s disease or stroke. There is a curable cause of dementia that is often associated with an unusual way of walking and with urinary incontinence.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                As they age, senior citizens may eventually develop abnormal personality changes, lose their recent memories, and/or become demented. There is a cause of these mental changes, called normal pressure hydrocephalus, which can sometimes be cured. Typically, a person with this disorder has difficulty walking. Their leg muscles work fine, but their brain does not remember how to use them—the result being that the person has lost the ability to purposefully initiate specific movements. In other words, they may not be able to coordinate well enough to walk. When they do walk, the pattern will seem quite erratic and awkward, and they will frequently fall. This condition is often accompanied by an inability to control the bladder.
            </p>

            <p>
                The brain sits in a clear liquid that flows into the inner chambers of the brain. If something blocks the natural flow of this liquid, too much fluid may accumulate in these chambers. The pressure from the excess fluid damages areas of the brain, causing the symptoms described above. Possible causes for this excess fluid are a head injury, brain hemorrhage, or meningitis (an infection in the sac that surrounds the brain). It can also occur without any known cause. It usually appears in senior citizens, but can occasionally occur in younger people.
            </p>

            <p>
                A diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus can be made with special studies of the brain, including a CT scan or an MRI. If the liquid-filled chambers of the brain are enlarged, normal pressure hydrocephalus may be present. Spinal taps are also used when making a diagnosis. Fluid is drained to decrease brain pressure, followed by a reexamination to look for an improvement of symptoms. The condition can sometimes be reversed with surgery, wherein one end of a small tube is inserted in an inner chamber of the brain, and is then sewn in place down the neck through the body to the belly cavity, where the excess fluid can flow.
            </p>

            <p>
                Family members of demented senior citizens should discuss with a brain specialist (neurologist) the possibility of a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus and the pros and cons of medical testing for it.
            </p>

            <p>
                This discussion should also include evaluation of other potentially reversible causes of senility, including decreased thyroid function (hypothyroidism), increased parathyroid function (hyperparathyroidism), vitamin B12 deficiency, the side effects of medication, alcohol damage, or the effects of a blood clot on the brain (subdural hematoma).
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: While many different conditions can cause a gradual onset of senility, any sudden change in memory, perception, or behavior in an elderly person could be a medical emergency such as a stroke, and requires prompt medical attention.

            A sudden change in personality may not be the result of a primary psychiatric disorder but may occur as a result of chemical changes in the blood or as a side effect of certain medications. Personality changes can also be caused by tumors, a brain injury (which may be unwitnessed),  a stroke, a seizure, decreased oxygen, or bleeding in the brain.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A sudden change in personality—including anxiety, apathy, confusion, bizarre or paranoid thoughts, excessive energy (mania), and irritability—may be one of the body’s red light warning signals of a treatable chemical or physical abnormality in the body, including the brain. It is important to seek medical evaluation in order to treat the underlying illness. In many cases, medical treatment can reverse the personality disorder. (See Tip 11 about combativeness after a head injury.)
