            A child who suddenly develops a harsh noisy sound when breathing in (called stridor) that does not go away when he or she is at rest should be seen immediately in the emergency room. However, if the stridor is from an inhaled object, it requires emergency first aid (see Appendix A, page 350). Croup (a "seal-like" barking cough) also requires an emergency room visit.
