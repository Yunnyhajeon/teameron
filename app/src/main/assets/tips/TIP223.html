            If your child starts complaining of significant, persistent pain in the bones, he/she should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude cancer of the blood or bone. The pain often first appears in the arms and legs, and gets worse over a period of a few days or weeks. Any refusal to bear weight (either standing up to bear one's own weight or carrying things) also warrants evaluation.

                Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a cancer of the blood and is the most common childhood cancer, occurring especially in two to six-year-olds. Two-thirds of children with this cancer first complain of bone pain, particularly around the knee. A preverbal child may simply cry a lot and want to be carried much more frequently. Sometimes the diagnosis of this disease is delayed because doctors fail to consider cancer as a cause of these signs. This cancer has a 90 percent cure rate, especially if it is diagnosed early.

                The most common childhood bone tumors occur in boys around the time of puberty. Early diagnosis is important because once the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body, the prognosis is much worse.

                Obviously there are many simple causes for leg pains in active children that are not worth worrying about. Bone pains that occur during the night after a vigorous day of activity in a child who is otherwise normal are generally not serious (e.g., growing pains). But if the pain is severe and constant, you should take your child to the doctor to rule out serious causes.
