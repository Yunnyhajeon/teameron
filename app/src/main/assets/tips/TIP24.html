            You may notice little spots or strings floating across your vision. If there is a change in the number or appearance of the floaters or if flashes appear, you should call your eye doctor immediately. They may be the warning signs of a retinal detachment tear, or hemorrhage.

<p>
                Most of us experience floaters from time to time and some people have more than others. They are caused when the clear jelly inside the eyeball shrinks with age. This jelly, called the vitreous, can tug on the retina of the eye, releasing a few cells or strings of cells. These are the spots and threads we see when we look at a white wall or a blue sky. The tugging can also cause little electrical currents to flash.

                But if you see a change in floaters or any flashes of light, it might be a sign of retinal detachment, which could cause sudden, permanent vision loss or blindness. If you see your eye doctor (an ophthalmologist) immediately, you may be able to save your vision. Don’t delay. If you can’t reach an eye doctor, go to the emergency room.
