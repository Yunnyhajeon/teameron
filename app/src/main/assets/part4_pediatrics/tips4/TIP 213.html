            If you have a child between the ages of two and six, and you notice a firm mass in his or her belly, seek medical evaluation. You may only notice that the child's belly is getting bigger and bigger, or is more firm than normal. Early diagnosis and treatment of a mass observed or felt in the belly will increase the chances of survival if he or she has kidney cancer.
