            Some signs of low blood  sugar  (hypoglycemia) are weakness, a rapid heartbeat, dizziness, confusion, profuse sweating, “acting weird,”  black outs, seizures, and unconsciousness. An extreme drop in blood sugar can occur in diabetics, which can be fatal if left untreated. Drinking fruit juice  and putting sugar under the tongue can provide immediate relief for these symptoms, but emergency medical evaluation and  treatment  may  also be necessary.
