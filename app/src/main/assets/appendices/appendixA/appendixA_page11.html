        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING COMES DIRECTLY AFTER THE SECTION TITLE
        Example: HEAD section title is directly followed by HEADACHE subsection in the book, aka 
                 headache is the first subsection of the section

        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING IS THE FIRST SUBSECTION OF THE SECTION

                HEAD TILT–CHIN LIFT
Place a hand on the forehead and two fingers on the chin. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin (in order to extend the neck). Make sure there are no objects in the mouth, but clear the mouth only if you see something. For children and infants: You still need to open the airway, but do not bend the neck too far—because this will actually close the airway.

            </p>

            <p>
                <b>B = Breathing</b>
            </p>
            Check for breathing by leaning down
and placing your ear and cheek just above the victim’s mouth. Look toward the victim’s chest, listen and feel for breaths (5–10 seconds).
<p>
If the victim is not breathing, prepare to begin breathing for them, following the guidelines below.
</p>
<p>
Note: Blowing too hard or too long into any age victim can force air into the stomach and cause vomiting. </p>
<p>
However, vomiting is a reflex; it does not mean that the victim is breathing or has a heartbeat. If vomiting occurs, roll the victim onto their side, help clear out the mouth, roll them back over, and continue providing CPR.
</p>
<p>
1. Check to make sure that there are no objects in the mouth. Clear the mouth only if you see an object.
2. Position your mouth to give breaths to the victim. The proper positioning of your mouth when giving breaths to adults, children, and infants are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adults (> 8 yrs of age): Pinch the victim’s nose with your fingers and make a seal around their mouth with your mouth.</li>
    <li>Children (1–8 yrs of age or < 55 pounds): Pinch the victim’s nose with your fingers and make a seal around their mouth with your mouth.</li>
    <li>Infants (<1 year of age): Make a seal with your mouth around both the mouth and the nose of the infant.</li>
    <li>Give two <b>slow</b> and steady breaths, for about one second each, lifting your mouth from the victim’s after each breath to let them exhale. Watch to be certain that the chest visibly rises when you provide each breath.</li>
    <li>If the chest does not visibly rise, continue trying to give the victim breaths until the chest does rise (re-tilting the head to open the airway before each try).</li>
</ul>
