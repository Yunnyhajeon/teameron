                    Make sure help is available: Rapid physician response to a sudden change in a patient’s condition can save lives.

                    There are teams of doctors and nurses specifically assigned to respond to any change in a patient’s condition long before he/ she experiences cardiac arrest and a “code” is called. However, a significant change in a patient’s condition may be missed by the nursing staff. Inquire about the availability of rapid response teams and how they can be accessed if the family identifies a problem. If a rapid response program does not exist at your hospital, suggest that they implement one.
