            An infant with swollen, tender fingers or toes may be showing the first signs of sickle cell disease. The early diagnosis of this disease and the treatment and/or prevention of accompanying infections (including additional immunizations) will reduce the child's risk of dying very young.

                Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder common in Africans and African Americans, affecting one in five hundred. It can also be found in people with Asian, Mediterranean, and/or South American origins. The condition affects the shape of red blood cells and causes anemia (a low red blood cell count). The abnormal red blood cells block the blood vessels, resulting in pain and a high risk of infection, particularly from certain bacteria. Some children with this condition die before they reach the age of five, yet with appropriate treatment and education, many patients with sickle cell will survive to their fifties or older.

                The typical first signs in an infant, as mentioned, are swollen, tender, red, and/or shiny fingers or toes. These signs may last for several days. The fingers and toes will be very painful, and the infant may seem distressed. An older, school-age child or adult will tend to have pain in the arms, legs, chest, and belly instead.

                The sickle cell diagnosis can be made from a simple blood test. Seek medical advice on how to deal with the various problems relating to this ailment. If younger children with sickle cell disease take certain antibiotics regularly, the risk of developing life-threatening infections will be reduced. Fortunately, these severe infections are now very rare in the United States, since hospitals screen for sickle cell disease at birth.
