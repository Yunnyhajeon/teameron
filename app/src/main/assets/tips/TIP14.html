            Delirium, which is severe confusion and disorientation, means that something is wrong and is affecting the
            brain, which could be very serious.

                Delirium is usually manifested by an altered state of consciousness consisting of confusion,
                distractibility, disorientation, and disordered thinking and memory. It often develops over short
                periods of time (within hours or days), as opposed to Alzheimerâ€™s dementia, which may take several years
                to be recognized. It will generally fluctuate from hour to hour. The person may merely seem detached
                from their surroundings or they may begin to tremble and become agitated, or even have hallucinations
                and a complete loss of contact with reality.

                Many ailments can affect the brain, thereby causing delirium. They include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Infections (most commonly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or infections of the brain)</li>
                    <li>Side effects of medication</li>
                    <li>Abnormal chemical levels in the blood</li>
                    <li>Low oxygen levels</li>
                    <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                    <li>Poisoning</li>
                    <li>Blockage of blood vessels going to the brain</li>
                    <li>Swelling of the brain from high blood pressure</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                When in a state of delirium, a person usually cannot reason, and therefore getting him or her to medical
                care may be difficult. He or she may be uncooperative and even combative. But this situation is urgent
                and requires immediate medical attention. Call for emergency assistance.
