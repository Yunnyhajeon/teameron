            Carbon monoxide gas is odorless and tasteless, and inhaling it can be fatal. If your child is in an enclosed area and starts developing headaches, possibly with nausea and vomiting, and especially if others in the area begin experiencing similar symptoms, it may be due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Symptoms are often subtle and may include weakness and/or drowsiness, which can cause one to fall asleep rather than evacuating the contaminated area. A more distinctive sign is that your lips and gums may turn cherry red. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you must evacuate the area and seek urgent medical treatment. Children and pets will usually be affected first.

                Sources such as a leaking gas furnace, pipe, or water heater may result in carbon monoxide poisoning. Using a charcoal grill, camp stove, or kerosene heater without proper ventilation, leaving a car running in an enclosed area, or inhaling fumes from a boat motor are other common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning.

                Sometimes the sources are not immediately apparent. Inexpensive carbon monoxide monitors are sold in most hardware or department stores and will alert you to dangerous gas levels. Consider installing one on each level of your home or boat. Have your home heating system (including chimneys) checked and cleaned by a professional each year, and if you use any kind of boat with a motor, the engine and exhaust system should be checked regularly as well. If you develop any of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning while in your car, get the exhaust system checked and make sure there are no holes in the floorboard.

                Though any children in the area will probably come down with symptoms first, carbon monoxide poisoning can kill both children and adults quickly. If several people in the household develop headaches simultaneously and/or become drowsy, everyone should leave the house immediately. Call the gas company, and get emergency medical attention.
