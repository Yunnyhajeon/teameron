            A child who suddenly develops a harsh noisy sound when breathing in (called stridor) that does not go away when he or she is at rest should be seen immediately in the emergency room. However, if the stridor is from an inhaled object, it requires emergency first aid (see Appendix A, page 350). Croup (a "seal-like" barking cough) also requires an emergency room visit.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Sudden onset of stridor is usually associated with difficulty breathing. The most serious cause used to be an infection of the epiglottis (the “hinged” flap over the windpipe that stops food from entering the lungs when you swallow). This is very rare now thanks to Hib immunization, which protects children from the germ responsible for this problem. In the case of a sudden onset of stridor, do not administer first aid for choking because this could make the condition worse. Do not put your fingers in his or her mouth. The first thing to do is to walk outside with your child if it is cool out, or open the freezer door and sit in the cool air. Even if his or her condition does improve with cool air, go to the emergency room.
            </p>

            <p>
                Frequently, the stridor will get better when the child calms down, but he or she should still be seen by a physician as soon as possible. Croup and inhaled objects are the remaining most common causes of stridor. If you suspect that an infant has inhaled an object (such as a coin, peanut, little toy, hard candy, piece of popcorn, carrot, or battery) and if he/she has a sudden onset of difficulty breathing, immediately administer emergency first aid. (See Appendix A, for basic instructions.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Croup is a viral infection around the voice box that typically causes a seal-like, barking kind of cough that gradually worsens. It is important to notify the child’s pediatrician if he or she develops this type of cough. However, if a younger child with this ailment develops noisy breathing that does not get better when the child quiets down, it may be lifethreatening. Keep the child as calm as possible (agitation worsens the condition), and get him or her to an emergency room immediately. Do not administer first aid for choking because this could make the condition worse.

            </p>

          <p>
            While stridor is caused by the swelling—and thus narrowing—of the airway, croup is caused by an irritation of the airway. Croup can turn into stridor in certain cases.

            <p>If your child has recurrent wheezing, especially when he or she gets a cold, or a recurrent nighttime cough, he/she may have asthma and should be assessed and started on appropriate treatment.</p>
            <p>Note: In rare cases, the wheezing may be caused by a foreign object lodged in the airway which requires urgent medical evaluation. If the child cannot speak and is clearly choking, you need to attempt to get the object out. (See Appendix A for instruction).

            <p>Asthma is an allergic or inflammatory condition. Certain triggers cause the small “air pipes” in the lungs to become inflamed and narrowed, making breathing more difficult and causing the individual to wheeze, cough, and, if severe, even struggle for breath. Some common triggers are sudden exposure to cold air, secondhand smoke, cats, dogs, dust mites, cockroaches, and exercise. Days with high ozone levels are also unhealthy for asthmatics; outdoor time should be limited when the air quality is bad. The morning news (both on television and radio) often gives reports on air quality. The daily Air Quality Index can also be found online and on the Weather Channel.
            </p>

            <p>
                Asthma is increasingly common, with many cases occurring in families with no previous history of it. Sometimes the child’s only symptom is a recurrent nighttime cough, and the diagnosis of asthma may be delayed, which could have serious consequences. Do not use over-the-counter cough syrups or over-the-counter bronchodilators (like Primatene Mist) if your child has asthma, unless prescribed by his or her pediatrician. In children with asthma, coughing is usually related to early wheezing.

                Asthma is a variable condition, and most children have mild disorders that are easily treatable, usually with inhaled medicine. Many will “grow out of it.” Some children, however, will experience severe life-threatening attacks. So get your child assessed by a doctor as soon as possible for appropriate treatment, and learn to avoid the specific “triggers” of his or her asthma attack (see Tips 57 and 212 for more information on asthma attacks). If your child has asthma and is over five years of age, ask his/her doctor about having your child’s breathing tested on a breathing machine called a spirometer, which measures respiratory gases. Also, do not allow anyone to smoke around your child.

            When your child has an asthma attack, you need to recognize the symptoms and know how to react immediately. The key to treating asthma is to prevent an attack from becoming severe (symptoms of a severe attack include struggling to breath, difficulty speaking, possibly turning blue, etc.). You can do this by responding appropriately to the first symptoms, which will be more innocuous and will include coughing, wheezing, etc. You also need to learn what triggers severe attacks of asthma for your child and try to specifically avoid these triggers. For many children with severe or persistent asthma symptoms, being placed on daily inhaled steroids can significantly improve quality of life with minimal to no side effects.

            <p>
                Nine million children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma. A severe attack can rapidly become life threatening in a child, whereas a mild attack may be managed carefully with home treatment using inhaled medication. The treatment at home should be conducted in consultation with the child’s physician. This involves using a nebulizer or metered dose inhaler that contains a bronchodilator to open up the airway and an inhaled steroid that reduces inflammation of the airway. The metered dose inhaler is most effective when used with a spacer.
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to be able to recognize a severe attack immediately. The child will struggle to breathe, will be unable to speak easily or walk across the room, and will possibly even turn blue. The loudness of the wheeze is irrelevant, and in fact a “silent chest” is even more serious. Call an ambulance (911 in most locations), and while you are waiting, start your child on their emergency medication (such as albuterol), if you have it. (See Tips 57 and 211 for more information on asthma attacks.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Be sure that the child’s medicine is constantly with them, even when you are not. Get a refill as soon as you start running low on the medication; do not wait until the next asthma attack.
