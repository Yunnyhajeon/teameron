            A flat deposit or plaque that is yellowish to white in color may appear in the skin above or under an eye, at the side of the nose, or in another area on your body, such as under the elbow. It can be the sign of a serious cholesterol problem.

                The deposit or plaque will usually be oblong in shape rather than round like a cyst, and will be about a quarter of an inch wide. If you have one of these, it will usually not cause you any discomfort. The plaque is inside of your skin, though, so you will not be able to remove it by squeezing out its contents.
            </p>

                The plaque is probably a fatty deposit, and as such, it may be a warning sign that you have a dangerously high blood cholesterol and/or triglyceride level. The cholesterol can invade the wall of an artery, eventually resulting in total blockage of the vital blood vessels that provide nourishment to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.

                These yellow, cheesy-looking plaques are a warning message that you should heed. See your doctor and have your blood checked for cholesterol and other fats. Plaques can be removed for cosmetic reasons, but they may recur, unless the underlying problems are resolved. Most importantly, high cholesterol and other fat levels in the blood should be lowered with diet and/or medicines. (See Tip 174 for more information on an elevated cholesterol level, especially in senior citizens. Also see Appendix C, for information on cholesterol screenings.)
