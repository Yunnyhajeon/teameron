            Weakness and/or tingling sensations in the legs, which usually progresses to the arms and upper body and causes breathing difficulties, may ultimately lead to paralysis and death. This rare ailment, known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, sometimes follows certain infections, vaccinations, or surgeries.

<p>
                When Guillain-Barré syndrome develops, the body’s immune system begins to attack its own nerves. The syndrome eventually interrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to the areas of the body controlled by these nerves. This will gradually result in the onset of paralysis in the legs (usually starting from the toes and moving up the body), accompanied by an increased difficulty in breathing. Death may occur if medical treatment is not instituted.

                Most people recover with proper treatment, but rehabilitation is lengthy. One form of treatment is plasma-pheresis, a process that cleans the blood of bound antibodies causing these nerve problems. High-dose immunoglobulin therapy (administering proteins that normally attack invading germs) can also help. If this latter procedure is done before the muscles for breathing are affected, it may prevent you from being put on a ventilator.

                If the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome occur, see your doctor immediately, or get to an emergency room.
