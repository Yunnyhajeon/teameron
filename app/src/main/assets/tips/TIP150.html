            In rare cases, a darkening and thickening of the skin around the back of the neck, armpits, and groin of an adult (usually over forty years of age) can be the sign of a serious disease, including certain cancers and/or diabetes.

<p>
                If you notice that your skin is darker than your normal skin color in places such as the back of the neck, the armpits, or the groin area, you may have a harmless skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans. In rare cases it can be the symptom of a dangerous disease. Two extreme possibilities are cancer of the stomach or of the colon.
            </p>
<p>
                Acanthosis nigricans is commonly found in dark-skinned individuals or obese people with high levels of the hormone insulin who are at risk of developing diabetes. (See Appendix C, page 383, about diabetes screenings.) Weight reduction may improve diabetes, but not necessarily the skin discoloration.
            </p>
<p>
                If you have this condition, you should see your physician for an evaluation to determine if you have any of the serious associated diseases.
