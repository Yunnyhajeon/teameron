            Fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache are the first symptoms of heat exhaustion and they may progress to a life-threatening case of heatstroke if you do not respond appropriately. Working or playing in the hot sun can be dangerous, as can a lack of proper ventilation and air-conditioning in the summertime (particularly for the elderly). Anyone who appears to act confused after being in a hot environment needs to be cooled down and taken to the ER immediately.
