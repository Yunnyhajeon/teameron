            The red light warning signals of lower belly pain, lower back pain, and problems with urination— such as slowing of the urine flow, increased frequency, a feeling of urgency to urinate, and/or pain on urination—indicate many different possible ailments for men. Infections of the urinary tract are important to recognize early since they can cause serious kidney disease if left untreated (see Tip 130). These symptoms can also be a sign of prostatitis or, rarely, prostate cancer.

                If you have an infected prostate gland (prostatitis), you may experience long-term pain and tenderness in the lower belly, pain in the lower back, or pain in the area behind the scrotum. You may also experience a burning sensation when you urinate and a slowing in the flow of your urine. When the prostate swells, it causes these symptoms by pushing against the urethra (the tube leading from the bladder through the penis to the outside). Prostatitis may appear with an inability to urinate and (rarely) with aching all over your body and a sudden high fever. The swollen prostate may be detected during a rectal exam, which would prompt further testing to make the diagnosis of prostatitis. Antibiotics are often the prescribed treatment.

                A person with advanced prostate cancer may also find that he has difficulty urinating, and that he experiences a slowing of the urine flow, with dribbling after completion. The most common cause of these symptoms is a benign growth of the prostate gland, but pay close attention. When it is prostate cancer, there are usually few symptoms in the early stages. It can become advanced before it is detected. The PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) blood test helps in the early detection of prostate cancer. All men age fifty and older (or forty and older for African-American men or those who have a first-degree relative with a history of prostate cancer) should receive a PSA test and a digital rectal exam annually. (See Appendix C, page 379, for details about this screening.)

                Prostate cancer is much more common in men over sixty years of age, but it can also occur in younger men. In general, when you are old and get prostate cancer, the disease will act old as well in that it is usually slower growing and less aggressive than when you are younger. However, while it is less likely to spread and become fatal, there have been some cases of aggressive prostate cancer in older men.

                If you are a man with lower belly pain and/or low back pain, or urination problems, see your doctor as soon as possible for evaluation and treatment.
