            Rocky Mountain spotted fever is identified by a high fever and a rash that appears as little red/ purple pinpoint blood spots or splotches. The rash usually begins on the wrists and ankles or the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads over the body. It is transmitted by ticks, so you will reduce your risk if you use insect repellent and remove any ticks from your body after each day spent in the woods.
