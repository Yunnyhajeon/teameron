            Pain in your legs, hips, and/or buttocks when you walk could be from arthritis but could also be from clogged arteries. When occuring in the leg, it is usually only in one. When the blockage of the arteries is total, gangrene of the leg and infection can occur. This infection may then spread to the rest of your body.
