            If you are having difficulty passing urine or cannot urinate at all, you need urgent relief. It is very important to determine the cause, which can be life-saving. Permanent correction is necessary to avoid kidney failure.

                The inability to urinate requires urgent treatment. If you are not able to urinate, try sitting in a tub of warm water three to four inches deep. After a few minutes, try to urinate in the water. Though it is a more extreme solution, your discomfort can also be relieved by your being catheterized (having a tube placed into the bladder, usually by a doctor or a nurse). In situations when you can only partially empty your bladder, urine remains and accumulates there, which is a prime setup for infection. If left untreated, this type of infection can spread into the kidneys and destroy them.

                What causes this problem of not being able to urinate? In men, an enlarged prostate gland may be blocking the flow of urine from the bladder, since the tube to the outside runs through the prostate. In both women and men, the urethra, the tube leading from the bladder to the outside of the body, may be narrowed by irritation and/or scars from an infection. Another cause of difficulty urinating may be the loss of strength in the muscles in the wall of the bladder, such that they are no longer strong enough to force urine through the urethra (the outflow passage). Diseases such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis can damage the nerves responsible for squeezing the bladder, while antihistamines and certain other over-the-counter medicines can constrict or partially close the bladder opening. This situation is self-perpetuating, as the longer the inability to urinate exists, the more the bladder wall expands, making it thinner and weaker, and this weakened wall is less able to squeeze urine out of the bladder.

                If the passageway from the bladder to the outside of the body is blocked, effective treatment may include medication or a procedure to permanently unblock it. In men with an enlarged prostate, a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test, an ultrasound, and/or a biopsy of the prostate tissue will help to determine if the enlargement is due to cancer. Early detection and treatment of cancer can be life-saving.

                In conclusion, when you have difficulty urinating, see your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room for urgent relief. You need timely follow-up by a urologist (surgical kidney specialist) to evaluate and treat the underlying problem.
