            The red light warning signals that you may have a rapid or irregular heartbeat are: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped or pounding beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, a feeling like “squirrels running around in the chest,” and a feeling like your heart is beating at the base of your throat. If you think your heartbeat is abnormally fast, slow, or irregular, take your pulse. An abnormal pulse can be a warning sign of many different life-threatening illnesses.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you feel that your heart is beating abnormally, take your pulse. To do so, take the pads of your second and third fingers, place them on the thumb side of your wrist, and find the pulsations of the artery. If your hand is palm up, the pulse is between the bone and the first big tendon (see Figure 8).
            </p>

            <p>
                Count the number of pulsations you feel in one minute:
                <ul>
                    <li>A normal rate is usually between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Normal ranges of resting rates vary from person to person. In other words, if your normal rate is 60 to 70, an abnormally high rate for you may be 90. Or if a normal resting rate for you is 85 to 95, then an abnormally slow rate might be 60. It is a good idea to check your pulse a few times while at rest so that you get to know the general range of your pulse.</li>
                    <li>A fast rate is a rate above your normal resting rate. Note: A resting rate above 100 is abnormal for anyone.</li>
                    <li>A resting heart rate is considered slow when it is below your normal range. For most people, a rate below 60 beats per minute is slow.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many benign reasons for an irregular heartbeat. It is normal for your pulse rate to rise to greater than 100 beats per minute with exercise, anxiety and stress, pain, or fever, and it may slow down significantly during sleep. It can also be influenced by herbal supplements/remedies or certain medications (such as Sudafed). In young, healthy people, irregular heartbeats are usually due to a small amount of abnormal electrical activity in a part of the heart; this can be brought on by stress, caffeine, or alcohol. In about 20 percent of the cases of irregular heartbeats in the young population, there is no explanation. These episodes of irregular heartbeats are usually harmless and will often go away when the heart speeds up during or after exercise.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, a rapid pulse could be the body’s red light warning signal of a life-threatening internal hemorrhage (usually accompanied by weakness and dizziness when you are switching from a lying position to a sitting position, or from a sitting position to a standing position).
            </p>

            <p>
                Irregular, fast, or slow pulses can be dangerous and require immediate therapy in an emergency room. (Examples of some of the more common causes are listed in Tips 85 through 90.)

            A rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. An elevated pulse is a common side effect of hyperthyroidism, dehydration, fever, anxiety, and certain medications. Also, a persistent rise in your pulse may be a sign that you are bleeding internally, often in the stomach or intestines. Any unexplained elevation in your pulse may indicate a need for medical evaluation and treatment.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Your pulse will normally go up when you run, climb stairs, et cetera, but a resting pulse around 115 or greater is always cause for concern, and depending on the cause, emergency medical treatment can be life-saving. A rise in pulse may be the first signal of a life-threatening hemorrhage in areas such as the stomach or intestines, followed by a drop in blood pressure. When blood loss occurs over a long period of time, a rapid pulse may be accompanied by fatigue and paleness.

            The onset of a rapid pulse, especially if it starts and stops suddenly and occurs intermittently, may appear with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, pounding or skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness and/or dizziness, and/or loss of consciousness. A sudden rapid pulse is most likely caused by an abnormality in the electrical system of the heart.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                When your heart suddenly starts beating too fast because of a heart rhythm abnormality, its rate will usually be over 120 and can even be as high as 160 to 200. This rapidity can interfere with the pumping action of the heart, so that blood flow is compromised. You may experience symptoms of weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, and, if severe enough, sudden loss of consciousness. If you experience any of these symptoms, have someone take you to an emergency room. Make sure you stop consuming all caffeine, street drugs, herbal products (including teas), and over-the-counter medications until you discuss your condition with a doctor. Also tell the doctor you had been taking these products. If you pass out even for a short time, and/or experience chest pain or shortness of breath, call 911.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sudden changes in your heart rhythm and a rapid or irregular pulse can be dangerous, particularly if you have previously experienced a heart ailment such as a heart attack, heart failure, or heart enlargement from high blood pressure.

            An irregular, usually rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: a feeling like “squirrels running around in your chest,” heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. If your pulse suddenly becomes irregular (and usually rapid), you may be experiencing a serious heart rhythm abnormality known as atrial fibrillation.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you have this condition, abnormal electrical impulses are originating from the upper chambers of your heart (the atrium), and are conducted to the lower chambers of your heart (the ventricles), typically in an irregular and rapid fashion. Your pulse is often very irregular and rapid, and can be very difficult to count. When the heart’s electrical system is in this abnormal state, the upper heart chambers are no longer effectively squeezing blood into the lower chambers, and this may result in blood pooling, which can sometimes lead to A blood clot. When this occurs, pieces of the clot can break off and travel through blood vessels to the brain, where they may lodge in a vessel and block blood flow to a part of the brain. This part of the brain will be damaged, causing a stroke.
            </p>

            <p>
                Atrial fibrillation frequently occurs in people with heart and lung disease, and in those with hypertension, but it can also occur in people who consume large amounts of alcoholic beverages or in people with an overactive thyroid (which is associated with shaking, tremors, exhaustion, and intolerance to heat). Please note, however, that atrial fibrillation sometimes occurs spontaneously in healthy people.
            </p>

            <p>
                Treatment of this disorder may include taking a blood thinner to prevent the blood from clotting. The doctor can convert your heartbeat to a regular rhythm with medication or an electrical shock applied to your heart. If you feel the onset of an irregular and usually rapid pulse with the above symptoms, seek immediate medical care.

            An electrical abnormality of the heart known as long QT syndrome can cause sudden death, especially in young adults, and even  in  children. The red light warning signals may include unexplained seizures or sudden loss of consciousness, often during physical activity such as swimming, when emotionally upset, or when startled by a noise. It’s also reported that people with long QT syndrome may experience an irregular heartbeat with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. However, it must be emphasized that these symptoms are very rarely associated with long QT syndrome and are usually related to other medical conditions.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The long QT syndrome, a serious heart rhythm problem that occurs in young people, gets its name from the EKG readout, as the syndrome increases the distance between the Q wave and the T wave (which may only show up on an EKG during exercise or on an ambulatory heart monitor). If someone has this syndrome, he or she is at risk of developing a dangerously fast heart rate, requiring cardiac shock or medication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even if you are young, if you have the above red light warning signals, it is worthwhile for you to be evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible, because it could be a warning that you have long QT syndrome. It’s very important that you get evaluated for this condition if you have a family history of drowning or of family members dying without any known cause at a young age.

            If you get an irregular pulse after you’ve experienced excessive fluid loss from diarrhea, water pills, and/or sweating, that irregular pulse may be the result of changes in the mineral levels of your blood, such as the level of potassium. This may have serious health consequences. The red light warning signals may include: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, heart pounding, and muscle cramps in the leg.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you have lost an excessive amount of fluid from any cause, including sweating, taking water pills, or having prolonged or severe diarrhea, you may lose large quantities of certain minerals such as potassium.  The loss of potassium can result in abnormal electrical charges in your heart, causing dangerous irregular heartbeats. This can be life-threatening; emergency medical therapy and monitoring by a physician is necessary. Often special intravenous fluids are needed to replace these minerals.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, heart rhythm problems can also occur if there is an excess of potassium or certain other minerals in the blood. If you experience these symptoms, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.

            If your pulse drops below 50 beats per minute, there may be a serious impairment in your heart’s pacing system that could cause serious symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, or sudden loss of consciousness. Although some well-conditioned athletes may  normally have a resting pulse below 50, a pulse lower than 40 in an athlete is a reason to seek medical attention  immediately.

        <div class="body_contents">

                Your heartbeat is regulated by specialized heart cells located in the upper chamber on the right side of the heart. If this area becomes diseased (or altered as a side effect of medication), it may begin to function abnormally, causing a sudden slowing of the pulse. Common medications that slow your heart rate include heart drugs like digoxin, beta-blockers like metoprolol or atenolol, and calcium channel blockers like verapamil or diltiazem.
            </p>

            <p>
                The slow pulse may be so severe it causes you to pass out, or it may occur intermittently, with your pulse returning to normal for a while. If this is occurring even for short periods of time, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.

            If you listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear a swooshing sound, it may indicate a heart murmur. You should seek medical evaluation by your doctor.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A heart murmur is a swooshing sound coming from within the heart. Heart murmurs are quite common and frequently do not indicate a serious problem. For example, they may be the result of blood passing rapidly but normally through one of the four valves (doors) in the heart (see Figure 9). A large percentage of adolescents have murmurs that are not caused by disease. But a murmur may be abnormal when a damaged valve in the heart contributes to making the sound. It may also occur when blood travels through an abnormal hole in a wall that separates two heart chambers.
            </p>

            <p>
                To understand why blood passing through a narrowed opening makes this sound, think about a garden hose. A garden hose makes little noise when water flows from it, but if you put a nozzle on the end, a swooshing noise is created as the water spews through the narrow opening. The same thing happens with the heart when blood flows through an abnormally narrow opening or rapidly through a normal opening. While listening to the heart with a stethoscope, the loudness, location, timing, and pitch of the murmur help the doctor to determine if and where the heart is damaged.
            </p>

            <p>
                Certain heart murmurs must be monitored by your doctor to determine if the problem is worsening and if and when the abnormality should be corrected so that permanent damage can be avoided. For example, one common cause of a heart murmur is a ventricular septal defect, a birth defect in which there is an opening in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. This opening causes an abnormal flow of blood, which can permanently damage the lungs. Diagnosis and treatment are essential. There are many other situations in which a murmur requires regular monitoring or medical intervention.

            <p>
                Both a damaged valve that has been infected in the past and an artificial valve provide prime targets for bacterial growth (bacterial endocarditis). Therefore, if you have these or certain other heart conditions and you are undergoing a procedure anywhere else on your body, it may be very important for you to take an antibiotic. For example, small amounts of bacteria can get in your blood during dental work or when tubes are put in your body to examine your bladder or colon. These bacteria may then grow on an abnormal heart valve or on an artificial valve in your heart. Appropriate antibiotics will kill any germs that get into your blood before they do damage.
