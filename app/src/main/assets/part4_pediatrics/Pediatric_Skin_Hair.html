            A child who has a fever (usually over 101 degrees), flu-like symptoms, possibly a stiff neck, and a rash that does not disappear when pressure is applied to it could have a serious bacterial infection (meningococcosis). He or she should be brought to the emergency room immediately. Note: The rash may appear faint and pink, or it may be flat, blotchy, and red or purple. It could also look like blood spattering or tiny pinpricks.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Fever and rash in a child can have many causes. The majority of them are viral, and in an otherwise healthy child they are not usually life-threatening. However, if your child suddenly develops a fever along with the type of rash mentioned above, especially if he/she is acting abnormally in any way, emergency evaluation is needed. Even a one-hour delay could affect your child’s chances of survival. Get him or her to an emergency room immediately.
            </p>

            <p>
               One cause is a bacterium called meningococcus (most common in children under two years old or between fifteen and twenty-four years of age), which produces a serious contagious infection in the blood that progresses rapidly. It often responds well to early treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Current recommendations are for adolescents to be immunized against meningococcosis between the ages of eleven and eighteen. However, the vaccines do not protect against all of the strains of this bacterium, and it may only offer protection for five to eight years.

            </p>

            <p>
                A fever, flu-like symptoms, and a quickly developing rash can also be caused by other medical conditions, including inflammation of the blood vessels after a viral infection. Also, a similar-looking rash that usually develops more slowly and without a fever or other symptoms could be due to a reduced number of platelets in the blood. The child is at risk of severe bleeding, for instance a brain hemorrhage. (See Appendix D, for tips on using a thermometer.)

           A red, flat birthmark (which may look like a wine stain) covering approximately one third of a child's face on one side may be associated with serious underlying brain abnormalities. The child should be thoroughly evaluated by a physician.

                Children with Sturge-Weber syndrome have a red, flat birth-mark covering one third of their face. There is an underlying abnormality, usually in the back area of the brain, on the same side. It may result in epilepsy, mental retardation, and/or a stroke (which will affect the opposite side of the body). Expert neurological (nerve) and ophthalmological (eye) assessment and care are needed to prevent or treat possible complications associated with this disorder. The condition is not known to be inherited.

            If your child has (or at one time had) freckling and increased coloration around the mouth or anus, they may have a condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This condition leads to multiple polyps (fingerlike growths) throughout the bowel, which may bleed, causing anemia (a low blood count) or bowel blockage.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a genetic condition, has a 50 percent chance of inheritance. The affected person has increased pigmentation and freckling around the mouth and often around the anus. This pigmentation can be a telltale signal of the presence of polyps in the wall of the gut. The polyps often bleed, resulting in anemia, and may also cause intussusception (where one part of the gut telescopes into the next). These polyps usually do not turn cancerous, but the child needs to be assessed thoroughly by a gastroenterologist (stomach/ intestine specialist). (See Tip 157 for more information on this disorder.)

            Does your child have five or more flat light brown birthmarks (each more than three quarters of an inch or 1.5 centimeters in diameter)? If so, they should be examined by an expert to exclude neurofibromatosis, an inheritable condition that may be associated with learning disabilities, epilepsy, and a high risk of malignant tumors.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Neurofibromatosis is an inherited condition that occurs in 1 child per 2,500. It is very variable in its manifestations. A child who has one or more of the following should be assessed by an expert:
                <ul>
                    <li>Five or more “café au lait” spots (light brown, flat moles) on the skin (each measuring over 1.5 centimeters or three quarters of an inch in diameter). They are most commonly found on the trunk of the body, and are usually not present at birth but appear in the first two decades of life.</li>
                    <li>Freckling in the armpits and/or groin</li>
                    <li>Plexiform neurofibroma, a lumpy overgrowth of parts of peripheral nerves, most common on the jaw and eyelids</li>
                    <li>Fibromas, or small, pink, non-painful lumpy growths on the skin that do not occur until puberty</li>
                    <li>Speckling on the iris of the eyes</li>
                    <li>Scoliosis or bowing of the legs</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                Adults may have neurofibromatosis but be unaware of it. Affected children may experience neurological problems during infancy, such as epilepsy, attention deficit disorder, and mental retardation. Those affected are at a high risk of developing tumors of the optic nerve (the nerve to the eye), the main nerve to the ear, and the brain. A precise diagnosis is especially important, since the family should seek genetic consulting.

            A combination of signs may be associated with Kawasaki's disease in a young, very irritable child. These include fever, red eyes, a redder-than-normal mouth, a rash, and/or enlarged neck glands. Signs may also include swelling and red and/or peeling skin on the hands and feet. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to prevent life-threatening heart problems.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Your child may have Kawasaki’s if he or she is under five and has a high fever (over 104 degrees Fahrenheit) that lasts for several days, accompanied by the following symptoms (doctors expect to observe at least four of these):
                <ul>
                    <li>Light sensitivity and red eyes</li>
                    <li>Mouth and lips that are redder than normal (the surface of the tongue may look like a strawberry)</li>
                    <li>Changes in the hands and feet (initially swollen, then red and peeling)</li>
                    <li>Rash</li>
                    <li>Swollen glands in the neck</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Kawasaki’s disease may initially resemble many other child-hood illnesses, but it is important to make the diagnosis and treat this condition as early as possible. Expert assessment is needed. Treatment for Kawasaki’s usually includes gamma-globulin and low-dose aspirin to prevent the formation of aneurysms (outpouchings) in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle, which may cause a “heart attack” in young children.

            </p>

            <p>
                See your doctor as soon as possible. Early treatment, including intravenous gamma-globulin and low-dose aspirin, can decrease the risk of life-threatening heart damage.

            If your baby is jaundiced (has a yellow hue to the skin and/or eyes) during the first week of life, you need to talk to his/her doctor as soon as possible in order to determine if there is a risk of life-threatening complications from high levels of the substance bilirubin.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Jaundice in the first week of life is often benign (not dangerous), but there are certain cases where it may be very serious.

            </p>

            <p>
                If the bilirubin (the substance that causes the jaundice) reaches high levels, it can cross into the brain, causing brain damage or even death. Mild jaundice is very common, affecting 80 percent of premature babies and 60 percent of regular-term babies, and is not serious. But certain causes of jaundice can result in a dangerously high level of bilirubin.

            </p>

            <p>
                A common cause of severe jaundice is an incompatibility between the mother’s blood type and the baby’s blood type. An inherited red blood cell disorder, including G6PD deficiency and sickle cell disease, can also cause severe jaundice. In these cases red blood cells are destroyed, and bilirubin is released into the bloodstream, causing the yellow coloring. Both of these conditions occur much more commonly in Asians and African Americans than in Caucasians. Since a yellow hue is harder to detect in these babies due to their skin coloring, their jaundice can be more easily detected by examining the color of their gums and the whites of the eyes. During the first weeks of life, babies have their eyes closed most of the time, so parents have to make a conscious effort to look carefully every day for the first week. Gently open your baby’s eyes and mouth to check for signs of yellowing. You may want to try darkening the room and using a flashlight. Babies open their eyes in the dark.


            </p>

            <p>
                Be aware that jaundice during the first weeks of life may also be caused by an extremely serious bacterial infection in the blood or a urinary tract infection.

            </p>

            <p>
                If there is no underlying illness, mild jaundice requires no treatment. Moderate jaundice can be treated easily by putting the baby under a special blue light, thus preventing the jaundice from becoming more serious. Severe jaundice may require an exchange blood transfusion, which is a major procedure.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your baby has these red light warning signals, see your doctor as soon as possible.

            There is an inherited disorder that is associated with the following signs: sparse hair, fragile nails, dry skin, and abnormal development of teeth (pointed teeth, missing teeth, etc.). This disorder is also associated with a condition whereby the body is unable to maintain the correct temperature. A child with this condition is in danger of dying from extreme heat within his/her body (i.e. an extremely high temperature).

                Several conditions, collectively called ectodermal dysplasias, involve the above abnormalities.

            </p>

            <p>
                Since the ability to sweat may be impaired, the child may be unable to regulate his or her temperature and become dangerously hot (hyperthermic). Even a mild illness may cause extremely high fevers. You must take specific measures to keep your child from overheating. Children with these conditions are also more susceptible to getting nasal and lung infections.

            </p>

            <p>
                A child with the above symptoms should be assessed by a skin specialist (dermatologist) as soon as possible.
