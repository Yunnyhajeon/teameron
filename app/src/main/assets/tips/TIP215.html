            If your child is experiencing an unexplained fever and/or frequent, sometimes painful urination, he or she may have a urinary tract infection. The child may wet his/her pants or bed, even if he or she is potty trained. The urine may also have  a dark color and/or strong smell. The signs and symptoms in a child are subtle, so it is important to be aware of them and take this condition seriously. Recurrent, untreated urinary tract infections in young children are one of the most common causes of kidney failure.

<p>
                Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants and young children can be extremely difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms are usually nonspecific: mild fever, frequent urination (sometimes with pain), and/or urine that smells particularly strong. It can also be difficult to get a clean sample of urine from a small child.

                If your child has a persistent fever with no other obvious cause (such as a cold or ear infection), you should have his or her urine checked by a doctor as soon as possible. If your preschool child has had a proven UTI, he or she should be thoroughly checked, in order to exclude a condition where the urine refluxes up into the kidney from the bladder. A child who has this problem is at a higher risk of damaging his or her kidneys and needs to be carefully supervised and treated. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent kidney damage and high blood pressure later in life. (See also Tip 130.)
