            Hand hygiene is important. If the people who are treating you have not properly sanitized their hands, you could be exposed to many different germs. Make sure your caretakers do not make this mistake.

                Reduce your chance of getting infected while in the hospital by observing the hand hygiene practiced by the hospital personnel and physicians. If they are not using hand sanitizers prior to performing their services, ask them why. When appropriate, request they do so.

            Improper removal of hair before surgery can increase the likelihood of a post-operation wound infection.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            For over a century it was the custom to shave a body area prior to surgery at that site. A recent study found that this method of hair removal actually increases the incidence of wound infection. So what now?
            </p>
            The proper way to prepare a site for surgery is to clip the hair instead of shaving it. So, if someone comes at you with a razor, ask them to use clippers instead. This may seem like a small point, but it is important. One-hundred-year-old customs do not die easily.
