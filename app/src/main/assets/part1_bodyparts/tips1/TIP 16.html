            A sudden change in personality may not be the result of a primary psychiatric disorder but may occur as a result of chemical changes in the blood or as a side effect of certain medications. Personality changes can also be caused by tumors, a brain injury (which may be unwitnessed),  a stroke, a seizure, decreased oxygen, or bleeding in the brain.
