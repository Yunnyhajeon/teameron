            Pain in the upper-right and/or middle belly area (with or without nausea and vomiting), often an hour or two after eating fatty foods, may be due to gallstones. If the upper-right belly becomes tender and the pain persists, and/or you develop a fever, the gallbladder may be infected.

                The gallbladder is located in the upper-right area of the belly, under the liver. It serves as a reservoir for bile, a substance made by the liver to help digest fat and protein. When a fatty meal passes through the stomach and enters the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum), a hormone is released that stimulates the gallbladder to squeeze bile through the bile duct into the intestine. When bile is stored in the teardrop-shaped gallbladder, stones sometimes form. These stones may be forced into the gallbladderâ€™s narrow neck when it contracts (squeezes). As it attempts to force the stones through its duct opening, it develops spasms, causing severe pain in the upper-right area of the belly. Nausea, vomiting, and distention in the upper-right belly area are often present as well. The pain may be constant or intermittent, and may occur more often after eating meals high in fat content. Note: Gallstones are most commonly seen in obese women in their forties who have had several children.

                If a gallstone is impacted in the neck of the gallbladder (like a cork in a bottle), the gallbladder will balloon out, become infected, and sometimes rupture. If a gallstone passes from the gallbladder neck into the common bile duct (a tube-like structure leading from the liver to the intestine) and blocks it, yellow jaundice will occur. Your skin and/or the white part of your eyes will turn yellow from the yellow bile backing up into your liver and bloodstream, spreading to all parts of your body. Blockage of the common bile duct can cause infection and/or even death.
            </p>

                Removal of the stones can save your life. Usually, the whole gallbladder is removed, using a fairly simple technique called laparoscopy, which involves inserting a special type of scope into the belly cavity.

                If you experience symptoms even after your gallbladder has been removed, seek medical evaluation. In rare cases, gallstones can form in certain tubes inside of the liver. These can be removed with a procedure called endoscopy, in which a tiny camera device is inserted into the small intestine to help remove the stones.

                If you experience upper-right belly pain often after eating fatty foods, with or without nausea and vomiting, seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Fever indicates infection requiring immediate treatment. (See Tip 128 for more information on gallbladder disease.)
