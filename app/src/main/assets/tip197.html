                Brain tumors are the most common type of childhood tumor. The early diagnosis of certain tumors can have a major impact on the child’s survival.

                If the cause of your child’s headache is a brain tumor, then the increasing pressure on the brain will cause headaches, usually in the morning, and these may be accompanied by vomit- ing and visual disturbances, most often double vision. Other symptoms may include unsteadiness during walking, slow growth in height, early puberty, seizures, or a personality change. Headaches can be caused by many non-serious conditions too, but it is important to have your child assessed and thoroughly evaluated as soon as possible.
