                How much weight loss is significant? If your body weight rarely changes, losing as little as five pounds could be significant. If your body weight varies eight to ten pounds from one season to another, you may be fine. But never ignore an unexplained weight loss of more than seven percent of your total body weight. The more rapid the weight loss, the more likely it stems from a disease.

               Body weight is determined by many different factors, including genetics, caloric intake, and physical activity. Caloric intake is the most important factor. Your body burns a certain number of calories per day, regardless of what you do. This is known as your basal metabolic rate (BMR). If you eat more calories than you burn, then you will gain weight, and if you eat fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight.

                    Diseases cause weight loss in numerous ways:
                    <li>If you are depressed, you may lose your appetite.</li>
                    <li>If you have a disease of the stomach or colon, you may limit your food intake due to the pain associated with eating.</li>
                    <li>If you have dementia, you may simply forget to eat.</li>
                    <li> Cancer releases substances into the system that can cause the wasting of body tissues and/or loss of appetite.</li>
                    <li>Diabetes results in an increase of sugar in the urine and therefore a loss in calories and dehydration.</li>
                    <li>An overactive thyroid gland increases the metabolic rate, and therefore causes you to burn more calories. If you have this condition, you will often lose weight despite eating more.</li>
                </ul>
         

            <p>
                If you have a significant unexplained weight loss, you need medical evaluation as soon as possible.

                Sometimes you may lose weight even though your belly size increases. Liver and heart disease as well as cancer of the ovaries can cause fluid to accumulate in the belly cavity, thereby creating this effect. (However, in extreme cases fluid accumulation could even cause you to gain weight.) Watch out for symptoms like bloating, indigestion, heartburn, and changes in bowel habits, as these may also occur with ailments such as ovarian, pancreatic, stomach, or liver cancer. Therefore, if you lose weight, but your waistline increases, it is important for you to seek medical evaluation as soon as possible.
