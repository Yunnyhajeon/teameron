            If you have a child between the ages of two and six, and you notice a firm mass in his or her belly, seek medical evaluation. You may only notice that the child's belly is getting bigger and bigger, or is more firm than normal. Early diagnosis and treatment of a mass observed or felt in the belly will increase the chances of survival if he or she has kidney cancer.

                Wilms’ tumor of the kidney occurs mainly in the two-to-sixyear age group, with a peak at the age of three. At the time of diagnosis, most children seem well and are simply found to have a large mass in the belly area, often discovered by a parent while bathing the child. The mass can often become surprisingly large before its presence is even noticed. There may also be a variety of nonspecific signs or symptoms, including constipation, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and high blood pressure. Twenty-five percent of children with Wilms’ tumor will also have a small amount of blood in the urine, which can only be detected when the urine is tested.

            </p>

            <p>
                Children with any of the following characteristics are at an increased risk of Wilms’ tumor:
                <ul>
                    <li>Abnormal kidney shape or structure (like a horseshoe kidney) from birth</li>
                    <li>Genital abnormalities (like hypospadias)</li>
                    <li>A family history of Wilms’ tumor</li>
                    <li>Certain syndromes, especially if one side of the child’s body is bigger than the other (hemihypertrophy)</li>
                    <li>No iris in the eye</li>
                    <li>Abnormalities of chromosome II (detected with a blood test)</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                Children with any of these risk factors should be checked regularly by a doctor to exclude a kidney tumor. An early diagnosis will result in around a 90 percent cure rate.
