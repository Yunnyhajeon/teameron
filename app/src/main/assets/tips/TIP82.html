            Chest pain that is worse when you are lying down but gets better when you sit up and bend forward may be caused by inflammation of the sac that holds the heart. This inflammation may lead to the accumulation of fluid in the sac, which will interfere with the filling and pumping of the heart.

                The heart is contained in a saclike structure called the pericardium. This compartment is located in the left side of the chest, and if inflamed, will cause pain in that area. Inflammation (swelling and irritation) of this sac is usually caused by a viral infection. It can also occur from a bacterial infection, the spread of a cancerous growth from the lung, the waste products released in the blood when the kidneys fail, or after a heart attack or some heart surgeries. Also, certain medications (procainamide, hydralazine, and the tuberculosis medicine isoniazid), can cause a lupus-like disease that may result in inflammation of the pericardium.

                Both the severe chest pain and the often associated shortness of breath produced by this condition (called pericarditis) may be similar to the pain from pleurisy, pneumonia, or even a heart attack. The special characteristic of pericarditis is that the pain is often worse when you lie flat on your back. Sitting up and bending forward can ease the pain by relieving the pressure on the sac that contains the heart. This does not mean that you absolutely have pericarditis, but you should see a doctor immediately for evaluation.

                A potential complication of this disease is the weeping of fluid from the sac wall into the compartment around the heart. If a large amount of this fluid accumulates, it can compress the heart such that it cannot effectively pump blood throughout the body, resulting in the failure of other organs. This is referred to as cardiac tamponade. It is important to have pericarditis diagnosed immediately so you can receive treatment and/or close monitoring of the ailment.
