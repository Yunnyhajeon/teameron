            A rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. An elevated pulse is a common side effect of hyperthyroidism, dehydration, fever, anxiety, and certain medications. Also, a persistent rise in your pulse may be a sign that you are bleeding internally, often in the stomach or intestines. Any unexplained elevation in your pulse may indicate a need for medical evaluation and treatment.
