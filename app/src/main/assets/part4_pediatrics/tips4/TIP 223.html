            If your child starts complaining of significant, persistent pain in the bones, he/she should be evaluated by a doctor to exclude cancer of the blood or bone. The pain often first appears in the arms and legs, and gets worse over a period of a few days or weeks. Any refusal to bear weight (either standing up to bear one's own weight or carrying things) also warrants evaluation.
