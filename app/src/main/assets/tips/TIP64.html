            Sudden shortness of breath, especially if accompanied by chest pain and a cough with bloody phlegm, may mean you have a blood clot in your lung. Tumors and certain pneumonias can also cause these symptoms. You need emergency evaluation and treatment.

                A blood clot in the lung occurs when a clot in a vein, often in one of the legs, breaks apart and a piece of it travels through the blood vessels into the lung. The clot may also originate in the right chamber of the heart. If the clot is small, a small area of the lung will be damaged. However, you should be aware that if you have had one blood clot, you are at a higher risk of getting another. The next one may be large; it could damage a more expansive area or even be fatal. The formation of a clot may take as much time as several days or as little time as a few hours. When the break-off occurs, however, it takes only seconds for the piece to travel to your lung.

                Anyone who has had surgery, prolonged bed rest, or has been sitting for a long period of time (such as while traveling by car or airplane) is more prone to getting a blood clot in a leg, often with tenderness and swelling in the back of the lower leg. Clots often also develop in the veins inside the pelvic area, with tenderness and swelling in the groin. This problem may not be noticeable until after the hospitalized patient is home. Shortness of breath could be the first sign that something is wrong.

                An injury to the leg can also be the cause of clotting in a leg vein, such that a clot from the injury site may travel to the lung. Please note: It is more usual for injuries to the leg to cause blood to flow out of the injured blood vessels into the tissue and then form large bruises or pockets of blood called hematomas. These pose little threat, since blood that clots outside of the blood vessels goes nowhere.

                Certain diseases can cause blood to clot more readily. Birth control pills and/or smoking may also increase blood clotting and, if possible, should be avoided if you have a prior history of blood clots. Women on oral contraceptives who smoke are especially at risk of developing blood clots in their lungs. Pregnancy also increases your chances of developing a blood clot. Whatever the cause, blood clots are life-threatening and require emergency therapy. (Also see Tips 175 and 249.)

                Tumors in the lung and certain pneumonias (including those caused by bacteria and tuberculosis) are some of the other ailments that can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and a bloody cough. If you develop any of these red light warning signals, get to an emergency room immediately.
