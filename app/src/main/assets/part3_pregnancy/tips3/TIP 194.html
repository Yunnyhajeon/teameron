            If you think you are pregnant (you have missed periods and have a positive pregnancy test), and you experience severe nausea and vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and/or discharge of grapelike particles, seek medical evaluation. These symptoms may be due to a tumorlike growth in your womb, which puts you in danger of hemorrhaging. An early evaluation and therapeutic extraction of the mass can be life-saving. About six percent of these growths are cancerous.
