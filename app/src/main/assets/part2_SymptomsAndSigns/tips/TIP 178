            If you are taking steroid medications (including cortisone, prednisone, hydrocortisone, or meth- ylprednisolone) and you get sick with any illness, you must be on the alert. These steroid medica- tions may make it difficult for you to recover from the new illness. Symptoms indicating that ste- roids are complicating another illness include (but are not limited to) fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps or weakness, and/or salt craving, which may require emergency care. These symptoms can also occur if you suddenly stop taking the steroids after taking them every day, or if you develop a disease in the adrenal glands.
