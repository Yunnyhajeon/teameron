            Upper-middle belly pain, bloody vomit, and/or black tarry stools can be caused by certain pain pills. These medicines can cause ulceration of the stomach and duodenum, which may  lead  to  the hemorrhaging and bursting of the stomach in the area of the ulcer. This problem has resulted in as many as 7,600 deaths in one year in the United States.
