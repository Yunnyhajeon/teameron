            Yeast infections cause a red sore on the skin with a buttermilk or cottage cheese–type discharge from the vagina. These infections can also appear as white patches in the mouth. Repeated yeast infections in the vagina, on the skin, or in the corners of the mouth may be a warning sign of diabetes or AIDS, so if you have repeated yeast infections, see your doctor as soon as possible.

                Yeast infections in the vagina frequently occur after a woman takes an antibiotic, because the antibiotic kills the normal bacteria in the vagina, allowing the ever-present yeast to overgrow. Often a white, clumpy discharge (like cottage cheese) will occur. These infections usually clear up promptly after treatment with an antifungal medication.

                Other common sites for yeast infections are on the skin near the groin, under the breasts, in the corners of the mouth, and even inside of the mouth. They are often accompanied by a burning sensation and a white discharge or plaque. These infections are usually also responsive to antifungal medication.

                If you have repeated yeast infections, you should be tested for diabetes. High sugar levels in the blood, paired with a defense system that is defective in protecting against infection, will increase the incidence of yeast infections. Early diagnosis of diabetes with proper therapy can reduce your risk of serious complications, including kidney, blood vessel, and heart damage.

                HIV infection can also create an environment for repeated yeast infections, because it weakens the body’s immune system. Testing for HIV is appropriate for early treatment and preventive measures to limit the spread of the disease to others.
