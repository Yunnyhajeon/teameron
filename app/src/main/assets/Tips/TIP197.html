                Brain tumors are the most common type of childhood tumor. The early diagnosis of certain tumors can have a major impact on the child’s survival.

                If the cause of your child’s headache is a brain tumor, then the increasing pressure on the brain will cause headaches, usually in the morning, and these may be accompanied by vomiting and visual disturbances, most often double vision. Other symptoms may include unsteadiness during walking, slow growth in height, early puberty, seizures, or a personality change. Headaches can be caused by many non-serious conditions too, but it is important to have your child assessed and thoroughly evaluated as soon as possible.
