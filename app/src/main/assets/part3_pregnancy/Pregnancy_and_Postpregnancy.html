        <h1>Introduction: Preventive Measures to Increase the Chances of Delivering a Healthy Baby</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- This section has a long intro before any tips -->
    <div class="body_contents">
            A pregnant woman can take many preventive measures to increase the chances that she will deliver a healthy baby, including the following:
        <ul>
            <li>She should avoid certain medications, because the side effects may endanger the fetus.</li>
            <li>It is important to be aware of past and existing illnesses as well as possible exposure to various diseases during pregnancy. For example:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If she is exposed to hepatitis B or whooping cough (pertussis) and she has not been previously immunized, she and her baby can benefit from vaccinations to reduce the risk of developing these life-threatening ailments.</li>
                        <li>If she is pregnant during the flu season (between October and May), it is recommended that she get a flu vaccination.</li>
                        <li>She should be seen routinely by her doctor for early detection of infections with subtle or no symptoms. These include periodontal (gum) disease, urinary tract infections, etc. These conditions increase the risk of preterm labor.</li>
                        <li>If she has papillomas (growths) in the vagina, she may need a cesarean (C-section) delivery so that the baby doesn’t get these growths in her throat when she is born.</li>
                        <li>If she has had high risk sexual behavior, chlamydia screening is recommended during the first and third trimester. Treatment during pregnancy can prevent passing the infection to the newborn baby.</li>
                    </ul>
            <li>A pregnant woman should be aware that though some degree of nausea and vomiting is very frequently the result of “morning sickness” during a normal pregnancy, severe nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss may indicate a more severe condition that may lead to dehydration, acidosis, and, rarely, premature labor. The inability to tolerate food, along with severe nausea and vomiting, should prompt an immediate evaluation by your physician.</li>
            <li>Vaginal spotting is very common during all stages of pregnancy. It may follow intercourse or be due to a minor condition like a cervical varix (a small fragile vein in the cervix that leaks a little blood). Vaginal spotting warrants a phone call to the physician, but bleeding as much as or more than a period warrants an immediate evaluation by your ob/gyn doctor or family physician, and may represent an impending miscarriage. If it is accompanied by any amount of pain, it is even more urgent</li>
            <li>Any pregnant woman who has experienced trauma of any sort should consider getting evaluated by a doctor. There are multiple potential risks to the mother and fetus for which early intervention is important.</li>
            <li>Some degree of shortness of breath during pregnancy is normal, but in the postpartum period it may indicate a more serious condition that requires medical evaluation, such as a blood clot in the lung. Symptoms of a blood clot may also include chest pain and/or an impending sense of doom.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Unfortunately this book cannot address all the preventive measures that can increase the chances of delivering a healthy baby. We recommend that pregnant women be monitored closely by their health-care provider and that they seek out educational programs and literature addressing these issues. It is proven that early prenatal care reduces death rates for both mothers and infants.

            If you are pregnant and you notice tenderness in the upper-right or upper-middle part of your belly (under the breastbone) and/or are experiencing a headache, blurred vision, double vision, dizziness, nosebleeds, swelling, and/or sudden weight gain, immediate medical evaluation is necessary. You may have preeclampsia, a dangerous condition associated with very high blood pressure.

        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Preeclampsia can cause severe high blood pressure, which can in turn lead to seizures (eclampsia) and coma. This condition usually appears during the last four months of pregnancy or during the postpartum period.
            </p>

            <p>
                The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown. It begins with changes in the body’s blood pressure control mechanisms that cause the blood vessels to constrict. The high blood pressure affects the kidneys, leading to significant weight gain and swelling. As the blood pressure rises to very high levels, you may also develop swelling in the brain and liver, leading to seizures and coma. This cascade of events is usually preventable when early treatment is instituted. The condition of preeclampsia may require delivering the baby early. If you develop the symptoms of preeclampsia, contact your doctor immediately.

            If you are pregnant and have any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical care:
            <ul>
                <li>Severe belly pain</li>
                <li>Leaking or breaking water</li>
                <li>Decreased or absent fetal movements</li>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            There are many potential causes of these symptoms. The more serious ones may put you and your unborn baby at serious health risks.
            </p>
                An emergency medical evaluation is needed for:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Severe belly pressure or pain.</b> In some of the most serious cases, this type of pain can be associated with internal bleeding in the uterus or rupture of the uterus at the site of the scar of a previous cesarean section. Other causes may include (depending on gestational age) tubal pregnancy, miscarriage, preterm labor, or infections.</li>
                    <li><b>Premature leaking or breaking of your water.</b> This can cause a serious infection in both you and the fetus. Also, in certain circumstances your water breaking early may compromise the blood and oxygen supply (via the umbilical cord) to the fetus.</li>
                    <li><b>Absence of fetal movement. </b> If you do not feel the fetus move or you feel a substantial change or decrease in fetal movement, you must be evaluated immediately by your ob/gyn</li>

            Certain infections during pregnancy cause premature delivery. Thus if you experience either burning on urination or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge, contact your doctor immediately.

            To avoid premature delivery, contact your doctor immediately for:

                <li><b>Bladder infections.</b> Such infections cause frequent urination, pain, and/or burning on urination. They can lead to a serious kidney infection, which can precipitate a premature delivery of the baby and make the mother very ill.</li>
                <li><b>A foul or fishy-smelling vaginal discharge due to bacteria.</b> This discharge may need to be treated to avoid pre-mature delivery of the baby.</li>

            If you are in the first four months of pregnancy and you have noted the reappearance of vaginal bleeding and/or cramping, it is important to check with your doctor immediately
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            This bleeding and/or cramping could be the first sign of an inevitable miscarriage, or a pregnancy that is failing. In this case, the embryo is likely to pass from the uterus (womb) through the vagina. You may have severe bleeding during a miscarriage, and surgery may be required in order to stop this bleeding.
            </p>

            <p>
            Another life-threatening cause could be an ectopic pregnancy. In this condition the pregnancy is in your fallopian tube. A pregnancy test will come back positive. An egg fertilized in the fallopian tube normally moves to the uterus and implants in the uterine wall, where it continues to grow. But if the embryo does not make it to the uterus, it will continue to grow in the fallopian tube, and the tube may rupture. This can lead to a severe life-threatening hemorrhage into the belly. You will not see the bleeding, although you may experience symptoms such as belly pain, weakness, a rapid pulse, dizziness, and a dark bloody vaginal discharge. (Also see Tip 7 for more information about emergency internal bleeding.) Sometimes you can feel when the tube ruptures; the sharp pain you may have been experiencing suddenly diminishes.
            </p>

            <p>
            Both of these conditions require immediate evaluation by a doctor. Vaginal bleeding and/or cramping in these circumstances are the warning signs of a potentially life-threatening condition.
            </p>
            <p>
            Alternatively, the symptoms may result from other causes, including certain hormonal imbalances.

            Any bleeding, with or without belly cramps or uterine contractions, demands immediate medical evaluation if it is on or after the fifth month of pregnancy. It may be a warning sign of a life-threatening hemorrhage.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            The life-threatening causes of bleeding during the later stages of pregnancy are related to the location of the placenta or “afterbirth.” Usually a fertilized egg situates itself inside the upper wall of the uterus. As the embryo grows, it is connected by the umbilical cord to the placenta (which is attached to the uterine wall). The placenta is like a pancake, filled with many small blood vessels growing on the inside wall of the uterus.

                uterus, over the opening of the birth canal (the cervix), it is more likely to cause painless bleeding and may hinder the fetus’ growth, as blood supply to the fetus is compromised (see Figure 15-A). With a complete placenta previa (when the placenta completely covers the opening of the cervix), a C-section delivery is needed. This is usually performed prior to the thirty-seventh week of pregnancy.
            </p>

            <p>
            In a condition called abruptio placentae, a normally placed placenta partially separates from the uterine wall and bleeds (see Figure 15-B). This condition is usually accompanied by severe abdominal pain and/or strong uterine contractions.
            </p>

            <p>
            In either case the baby can lose its blood supply, which deprives the baby of oxygen and nutrition, endangering its life. The mother’s life is also threatened because there is the potential of massive internal bleeding. Urgent medical evaluation and treatment are necessary.

            If you think you are pregnant (you have missed periods and have a positive pregnancy test), and you experience severe nausea and vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and/or discharge of grapelike particles, seek medical evaluation. These symptoms may be due to a tumorlike growth in your womb, which puts you in danger of hemorrhaging. An early evaluation and therapeutic extraction of the mass can be life-saving. About six percent of these growths are cancerous.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            A hydatidiform mole is a tumor like mass that can grow in your womb such that you seem to be pregnant. This condition, which occurs in about one out of 1,200 pregnancies, is caused by an abnormal egg implanting in the wall of the womb. The fetal parts (tissue) may or may not be present, but the placenta (the pancake like attachment that normally provides nourishment for the baby) grows rapidly and produces the hormones of pregnancy. Fingerlike projections of the placenta invade the wall of the womb, acting like a cancerous growth. They swell and degenerate, causing you to bleed from the vagina. The projections themselves look like grapes when they pass with the bloody discharge. This condition is known as a molar pregnancy.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you think you are pregnant but have signs and symptoms suggesting a molar pregnancy, it is important that you seek emergency medical care to have the mass removed from your womb. Not only are you in danger of a life-threatening hemorrhage, but the fingerlike projections of the placenta can also turn cancerous and spread throughout your body.

            If you have a fever and belly discomfort soon after you have given birth to a baby, it may indicate that you have a serious infection of the womb, which could spread rapidly. Heavy bleeding is also a possible warning signal of a life-threatening hemorrhage.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            You may already be home after delivering your baby when you develop a fever and belly pains. These symptoms may indicate an infection in your uterus (womb). This is dangerous; even a mild infection in this location can become major and spread rapidly throughout your body, because after delivery the internal lining of the uterus has many small blood vessels. Immediate medical evaluation and treatment can be life-saving.
            </p>

            <p>
            If you are soaking blood through more than one pad (sanitary napkin) each hour, you are at risk of having a serious hemorrhage. Contact your health-care provider immediately.
