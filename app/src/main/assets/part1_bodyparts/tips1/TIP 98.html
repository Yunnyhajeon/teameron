            If you experience upper-middle belly pain (with or without vomiting blood and/or passing black tarry stools), you may have an ulcer or inflammation in the stomach and/or an ulcer in the duodenum. Drinking alcohol may increase the risk of developing ulcers and also prevent the healing of ulcers that are already present. It can also make pancreatitis worse, increasing the possibility of fatal complications.
