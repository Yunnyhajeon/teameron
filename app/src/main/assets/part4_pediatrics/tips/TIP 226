            If your child has (or at one time had) freckling and increased coloration around the mouth or anus, they may have a condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This condition leads to multiple polyps (fingerlike growths) throughout the bowel, which may bleed, causing anemia (a low blood count) or bowel blockage.
