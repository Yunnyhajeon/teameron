            Constipation is a very common symptom in babies, and is often associated with dietary issues. Also, the bowel habits of babies are different from those of adults--babies can often go longer without a bowel movement. However, if your baby has suffered from chronic severe constipation since birth, which may have included problems with passing meconium (the dark sticky stools) at birth, he or she may have an abnormality in his/her nerve supply to the large bowel. This condition requires surgery to prevent bowel obstruction and life-threatening inflammation or perforation of the bowel. There are also other problems that may cause severe constipation, including a defective anus.

                Hirschsprung’s disease is a condition in which the nerve supply to the large bowel is abnormal. Boys are affected about five times more commonly than girls, and the disease is more frequent in children with Down’s syndrome. The symptoms depend on the length of bowel affected, which varies from a few centimeters near the anus to the entire length of the large bowel.
            </p>

            <p>
                If only a short segment of the bowel is involved, diagnosis may be delayed. Any baby who does not pass a stool in the first twenty-four hours of his or her life and does not have another obvious bowel problem or an anal abnormality should be investigated for this condition. Children who have been constipated since birth should also be investigated. If a diagnosis is not made quickly, the bowel may become blocked, inflamed, and could even burst (perforate). Note: It is common for a healthy toddler who has previously had normal bowel movements to experience constipation while potty training.

            If you infant is crying abnormally as if having labor pains, pulling up his or her knees, and/or passing bright red or maroon-colored stools, he or she needs to be brought to the emergency room immediately.

                Babies may get a condition in their bowels (called intussusception) wherein one portion of the bowel telescopes into the next and gets stuck. This blocks the bowel and cuts off the blood supply to that portion of bowel. If the condition is not reversed rapidly, the bowel will die, and the infant will become very ill.
            </p>

            <p>
                It may be difficult to differentiate a baby with colic (spasmodic pain in the abdomen) from one with intussusception. A baby with intussusception may spontaneously cry in regular intervals when he or she is apparently content. This pattern can be likened to the pattern of labor pains. A sausage-shaped lump may be felt in the belly, and in rare cases the baby may pass jellylike stools. If intussusception is diagnosed early, it can often be cured by a special enema, avoiding the need for surgery. This should always be done by an experienced doctor. This condition is an emergency. Get your child to an emergency room immediately.

            If a child or infant has more than a small amount of blood in his or her stools repeatedly and/or severe cramping during an episode of diarrhea, it increases the chance that the illness is a serious one and will require immediate medical attention.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Older children may flush the toilet without observing the nature of a diarrhea stool. They should be asked to look at the stool and show it to an adult if it is abnormal. With the emergence of E. coli as a potentially very dangerous germ, it has become important that parents watch diarrhea carefully (see Tip 220 for more emergency information on diarrhea in babies and children). Large numbers of stools, severe cramping with diarrhea, and blood in the stools should cause parents to seek medical attention.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember, when observing the stool, that if the child drinks red liquids or eats beets, the stool may have a red color.

            Dehydration or other complications due to excessive loss of fluid needs to be avoided in a baby or child who has diarrhea and/or vomiting. It can be life-threatening.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Diarrhea and vomiting are both common problems in babies and infants. Dehydration can occur rapidly, especially if the infant also has a fever.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child has diarrhea and/or vomiting and any of the following symptoms, you should get him or her to the emergency room.
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent vomiting if the baby is under three months of age. Some doctors suggest that “frequent” means more than three times in four hours, but it could be less often, depending on the severity of the vomiting.</li>
                    <li>Signs of dehydration:
                        <ul>
                            <li>excessive drowsiness or irritability, or limpness</li>
                            <li>sunken eyes and sunken fontanel (soft spot on the head)</li>
                            <li>loose, dry skin</li>
                            <li>dry mouth and tongue</li>
                            <li>very little, dark-colored urine (less than three wet diapers in twenty-four hours)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Persistent belly pain</li>
                    <li>Very forceful, recurrent vomiting (projectile), in a baby; green or bloody vomit</li>
                    <li>Blood in the stools (small streaks without any other signs or symptoms are not an emergency, but warrant contacting the child’s doctor)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                In children over six months, dehydration may be prevented by giving oral solutions such as Pedialyte. Consult with the child’s physician before giving these solutions to babies younger than six months of age, since they do not have the important nourishment that a baby needs. You may be able to continue giving breast milk or formula. They are best when given in small volumes at frequent intervals, and they can be very effective. If your child is still vomiting occasionally, you may have to give him/her as little as a teaspoon at a time.  Solutions that contain a high sodium content, such as Rehydralyte, should only be given to a child (of any age) on the advice of a physician.
            </p>

            <p>
                Viruses are the most common cause of diarrhea in children. Babies who are exclusively breast-fed until they are six months of age very rarely get significant diarrhea. Eating undercooked ground beef and unwashed vegetables increases the risk for dangerous E. coli diarrhea.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child has vomiting or diarrhea, ask a physician how much regular food and how much of these rehydration solutions are appropriate for him or her.
