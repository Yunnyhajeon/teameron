            An injury to the belly area can result in damage to the spleen, and a subsequent life-threatening internal hemorrhage many days after the accident. The warning signals may be worsening or recurring upper-left belly pain, often accompanied by left shoulder pain, and/or suddenly feeling weak or faint. These symptoms may be experienced many days after the injury.
