            If one of your eyelids droops, you’re seeing double, and/or your pupils are unequal in size, you may have a ballooning blood vessel (aneurysm) in your brain that could burst. Other causes could include nerve damage or possibly a brain  tumor.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                An eyelid that does not move normally, pupils that are unequal in size, and/or seeing double may indicate that the nerves controlling these functions are not transmitting impulses normally (see Figure 2). Any abnormality in the brain or surrounding structures that puts pressure on these nerves can cause the above symptoms. For example, a blood vessel that is ballooning out (aneurysm) at a specific location could press on these nerves. If this is the case, you need emergency medical evaluation—brain surgery may be required to prevent the blood vessel from bursting.
            </p>

            <p>
                If one eyelid droops and the pupil of the same eye is smaller than the other, it may be evidence of a condition called Horner’s syndrome, which means that a very specific nerve is being damaged. These symptoms are a major cause for concern if they are accompanied by a lack of sweating or flushing on that same side of your face.

            <p>
                Alternatively, your symptoms could also be caused by a tumor or a defective artery in the neck that causes damage to a specific nerve that affects only one side of the face.
            </p>

            <p>
                In any of these situations, you need to seek immediate medical evaluation.

            If your eyelids droop part of the time and you have double vision, or your jaw gets tired while chewing, you may have a serious neurological problem called myasthenia gravis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Do people ask, “Why don’t you open your eyes all the way? You look like you’re sleepy”? Does your jaw get so tired at times when you are eating that you can’t take another bite? If you have droopy eyelids, a weary jaw, difficulty swallowing, and/or general weakness, especially as the day progresses, you may have a potentially serious nerve disorder called myasthenia gravis.
            </p>

            <p>
                With myasthenia gravis there is a blockage of the chemical that is needed for sending messages through your nerves to certain muscles in your body, and only a weakened nerve signal gets through. Weakened muscles make it hard to chew and cause your eyelids to droop. Other muscles, including breathing muscles, may also become weak. The weakness usually worsens with prolonged use of the muscle groups in question, and is often referred to as “fatigable weakness.” If this ailment is left untreated, it could be fatal since you could stop breathing. Effective medications can control myasthenia gravis, so if you experience these red light warning signals, see your doctor as soon as possible.
