            The bite of an animal with rabies can be fatal. Therefore, if you are bitten by a dog, cat, raccoon, fox, skunk, horse, bat, or any other warm-blooded animal, you need immediate medical attention. Note: You can also get rabies from exposure to the saliva of a rabid animal (via contact with an open wound or your mucous membranes). For example, bats flying in the room of a sleeping person or near an awake, unattended child have been reported to have spread the disease to the individual, even when there has been no evidence of a bite.

                Animals with rabies, including dogs, cats, horses, skunks, bats, foxes, and raccoons, can transmit their disease to you through a bite. The virus can also be transferred if the animal’s saliva comes in contact with an open cut on your body or with your mucous membranes—for example, your eyes or mouth. If you get the appropriate immunoglobulin and vaccination shots after contact with a rabid animal, you can avoid developing the disease.

                Fortunately the time between your exposure to the disease and the appearance of symptoms is normally within two to twelve weeks (though this can happen over a shorter or much longer period of time). If you are bitten by a pet that appears healthy, observe the animal for ten days and begin to get postexposure rabies treatment only if it begins to act strangely. If the pet is rabid or suspected rabid, you will need immediate treatment, which involves receiving a series of shots. If you are bitten by a wild animal, such as a bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, or most other carnivores, the animal should be regarded as rabid unless it can be captured and proven negative with laboratory testing. If the animal is not captured, immediate vaccination should be considered. This is crucial, since untreated rabies is almost one hundred percent fatal.

                If you are going to be traveling to developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially if you plan to spend time hiking, consult with your health-care provider about getting a pre-exposure vaccination against rabies. In these countries, dog rabies may be more common and  preventive treatment can be difficult to obtain. Keep in mind that pre-exposure vaccination does not offer full protection; however, it reduces the amount of post-exposure therapy needed and allows you to go a longer time before getting it.

                Of course, whenever you get bitten by an animal, follow standard first-aid protocol; wash the area immediately with soap and water, apply antibiotic ointment, etc.
