                The early signs of arsenic poisoning are sometimes a garlic odor on the breath and a metallic taste on the tongue. Later symptoms include vomiting and a burning, upset stomach. You may also experience other symptoms, including a burning and tingling in your arms and legs (which results from the damage to your nerves). Note: The early symptoms of arsenic poisoning can also be caused by certain medications like Biaxin, which tend to give you an abnormal taste in your mouth.

                Arsenic poisoning has been known to occur in incidents of mail-order poisoning. No doubt you have also heard of food supplements or medications being intentionally laced with arsenic and distributed.

                Call your local poison control center or the national poison control number (1-800-222-1222) for additional information and advice on appropriate evaluation and treatment if you suspect that you have been exposed to arsenic.
