            A bull’s-eye red rash, with or without joint pain, could be a sign of Lyme disease from a tick bite. However, other skin conditions can also appear as red circles. Any bull’s-eye rash requires diagnosis by a physician.

                The initial event in Lyme disease is often this skin rash: a reddened area, circular in shape, with more intense redness at the center. The rash itself will clear up without treatment, but the disease will spread to other areas of the body. You may initially have flu-like symptoms and/or a fever. As the disease progresses, you may also develop joint pain, weakness, and fatigue. Eventually the brain and heart will be damaged.

                If you have this type of rash, contact your doctor immediately. Treating Lyme disease with antibiotics during the rash phase is very effective and will usually cure it. When the infection spreads to other parts of the body, treatment becomes more complicated. Chronic Lyme disease can be a very disabling illness.

                Although Lyme disease is not very common, it does pose a threat, especially in the Midwest and along the Atlantic coast. The tick that transmits the disease is smaller than most, so the bite often goes unnoticed.
