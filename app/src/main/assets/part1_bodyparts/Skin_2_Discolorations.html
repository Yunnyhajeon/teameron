            Changes in your pattern of bruising, little black or red dots on your skin (which may look like pin-size bleeding spots), nosebleeds, gum bleeds, rectal bleeds, or bleeding too long after a cut are all indications that you may have blood-clotting problems from an ailment or as the side effect of a medication (such as aspirin or other pain pills).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Blood clotting requires a cascade of many different chemical reactions. If anything interferes with this cascade of reactions, your blood may not clot normally. For example, certain clotting substances are made in the liver, so if you have a liver ailment, you may bleed more easily. Also, hemophiliacs are born without a specific clotting factor and need to be given a replacement for it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Particles in your blood called platelets prevent blood from leaking out of the capillaries, your tiny blood vessels. Platelets also release chemicals that aid in the clotting process, so if you begin to bruise or bleed easily, it could be the result of a low platelet level. This latter condition might be a side effect of a medication you are taking or the result of a disease that destroys platelets, such as an enlarged spleen or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is more commonly seen in children. (SeeTip 214.) 
            </p>

            <p>
                These symptoms require immediate medical attention, since it places you at a higher risk of bleeding in your brain (a stroke) or bleeding internally at some other site in your body.

            In rare cases, a darkening and thickening of the skin around the back of the neck, armpits, and groin of an adult (usually over forty years of age) can be the sign of a serious disease, including certain cancers and/or diabetes.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you notice that your skin is darker than your normal skin color in places such as the back of the neck, the armpits, or the groin area, you may have a harmless skin condition known as acanthosis nigricans. In rare cases it can be the symptom of a dangerous disease. Two extreme possibilities are cancer of the stomach or of the colon.
            </p>

            <p>
                Acanthosis nigricans is commonly found in dark-skinned individuals or obese people with high levels of the hormone insulin who are at risk of developing diabetes. (See Appendix C, page 383, about diabetes screenings.) Weight reduction may improve diabetes, but not necessarily the skin discoloration.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have this condition, you should see your physician for an evaluation to determine if you have any of the serious associated diseases.

            Dark spots (brown in African Americans and Asians, pink to dusty red in Caucasians) on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet may be a sign of syphilis or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If treated early, fatal complications can be avoided.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                While the telltale dark spots of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are usually accompanied by a high fever and severe headache (see Tip 162 for additional information on Rocky Mountain spotted fever), dark spots may be the only sign that the syphilis germ is living in your body. Also, since Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by a germ transmitted by a tick bite, finding a tick on your body is an immediate tip-off that you may have contracted the disease. Syphilis, on the other hand, is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is important to diagnose and treat early because the damage it may do to the body organs cannot be reversed. It is particularly dangerous in pregnant women, as it can be passed to the fetus and cause life-threatening complications for the baby.

            Turning blue often indicates that you are getting an insufficient oxygen supply. This is commonly seen in children with inherited heart abnormalities and people with lung disease, but it can also occur as a side effect of certain medicines and from other causes. If your skin turns blue, you need immediate medical evaluation and possibly treatment.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Most people think that when the skin turns blue, it is from an inability to breathe. It is true that cutting off your oxygen supply will make you turn blue in a hurry. But there are also other possible reasons for this skin discoloration.
            </p>

            <p>
                Normally oxygen attaches to a protein called hemoglobin in your red blood cells. This occurs as blood travels through the vessels in your lungs. The oxygen is then transported throughout the body by the red blood cells for use by all of the body’s organs. This gives a normal pink color to the skin of Caucasians and to the mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, nose, eyes, and so on) of all people. If the oxygen supply to the blood is cut off for any reason, then the hemoglobin circulates without oxygen, giving the skin a blue appearance, called cyanosis.
            </p>

            <p>
                As mentioned, certain medications and other maladies can also lead to this red light warning signal. They can alter the hemoglobin in some of your red blood cells such that they are unable to carry oxygen, turning your skin a bluish color.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your skin and/or lips turn blue, you need to be evaluated by a doctor immediately to determine the underlying cause. Your organs may not be receiving sufficient oxygen, which can have a long-term negative effect on your health. In many cases therapeutic intervention can reverse the disorder.

            A low count of red blood cells (anemia) can cause paleness, fatigue, and a rapid pulse with or without shortness of breath. In certain cases you may feel dizzy or pass out. Diagnosing and treating causes of a low blood count can be life-saving.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                There are many reasons why you could have a low blood count, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Poor nutrition</li>
                    <li>A disease that destroys the bone marrow, where red blood cells are made</li>
                    <li>A drug that causes red blood cells to break apart</li>
                    <li>Cancer in the colon with a slow bleed</li>
                    <li>Heavy menstrual flow</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to seek medical attention to diagnose the cause of your low blood count because, in many cases, early treatment can cure the underlying ailment. This is also important because—apart from the possibility of a serious underlying condition—a very low blood count can do significant damage to your organs all on its own. Red blood cells have the vital role of supplying oxygen to your brain and heart. For that reason, when your blood count is dangerously low, an immediate emergency blood transfusion may be needed to save your life.
            </p>

            <p>
                The doctor can easily tell how low your blood count is by drawing a sample of your blood and performing a simple test. (See Appendix C, page 384, about blood test screenings.) If you have symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and/or pale skin, you should see a doctor right away to determine your blood count and get a thorough evaluation. If you also have a rapid pulse, the bleeding may be sudden, requiring immediate transport to an emergency room.

            If you notice a serious skin sensitivity to the sun, check the side effects of the medicines you are taking. Other possible causes include lupus and other diseases.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Hundreds of medicines can make your skin sensitive to the sun. There are two main types of reactions:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Phototoxic reaction.</b> This type of reaction occurs immediately after you begin taking the offending medication, because it causes the skin to be much more sensitive to the ultraviolet light of the sun. This can create such an intense sun sensitivity that a normally harmless amount of sunlight may burn your skin.</li>
                    <li><b>Photoallergic reaction.</b> This type of reaction is due to an allergic sensitization of the skin by a drug. It appears after being on the medicine for a while (24 to 72 hours, or even as long as a few weeks). Skin exposed to the sun may develop eczema, hives, small fine bumps, hard plaques, or blisters. There is a chance that these reactions will continue to recur for some time after the drug has been discontinued.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Even visits to sun-tanning salons can cause these symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since so many different medicines can cause these reactions, consult your doctor to determine if a drug you are taking may have these side effects. You can also consult with your pharmacist and ask for a copy of all of the package inserts for the medicines you are taking (both prescription and nonprescription) to see if skin sensitivity to the sun is a side effect, and, indeed, if there are any other side effects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both phototoxic and photoallergic reactions can be very serious and may even be fatal. If you develop a reaction, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible to determine the safest way to deal with it (for example, by changing medicines). Don’t make these decisions alone.
