            Tenderness and pain in the back of your lower leg, chest pain, and/or shortness of breath, occurring after sitting for a long time (e.g., after a long airplane trip), or after lying in bed for an extended period of time, are symptoms of a potentially dangerous blood clot.

<p>
                A blood clot can form in your leg during a long trip in a car or an airplane or when you are bedridden for even a short time. The sitting and lying positions cause more pooling of blood in the legs than standing does. When your legs are still, lack of leg-muscle activity results in less blood flowing up from the legs. The blood that pools in your legs is more likely to clot. When this happens, the back lower part of your leg, in the area of the calf, gets swollen, painful, and tender to the touch (see Figure 7). If this is accompanied by sudden chest pain or shortness of breath, a piece of a blood clot formed in your leg may have broken off and traveled through the bloodstream to your lungs. You need to be taken to an emergency room immediately, because this condition can cause life-threatening damage to your lungs.

<p>
                The formation of blood clots can often be prevented if you take short walks to break up long periods of sitting. If you are taking a long trip, occasionally get up and stroll down the aisle of the airplane or stop the car and step outside for a break. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Don’t drink alcohol, which causes you to urinate frequently and lose more fluid. If you are bedridden, try to take short walks, even if it is only to the bathroom and back. (See Tip 139 for other causes of blood clots forming in the leg.)

                Note: If you have had blood clots in your legs before, you are at a higher risk for getting blood clots in the future. This is especially true if you have been prescribed blood thinners by your doctor and have not been taking them.
