            A child who has a fever (usually over 101 degrees), flu-like symptoms, possibly a stiff neck, and a rash that does not disappear when pressure is applied to it could have a serious bacterial infection (meningococcosis). He or she should be brought to the emergency room immediately. Note: The rash may appear faint and pink, or it may be flat, blotchy, and red or purple. It could also look like blood spattering or tiny pinpricks.

                Fever and rash in a child can have many causes. The majority of them are viral, and in an otherwise healthy child they are not usually life-threatening. However, if your child suddenly develops a fever along with the type of rash mentioned above, especially if he/she is acting abnormally in any way, emergency evaluation is needed. Even a one-hour delay could affect your childâ€™s chances of survival. Get him or her to an emergency room immediately.

               One cause is a bacterium called meningococcus (most common in children under two years old or between fifteen and twenty-four years of age), which produces a serious contagious infection in the blood that progresses rapidly. It often responds well to early treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Current recommendations are for adolescents to be immunized against meningococcosis between the ages of eleven and eighteen. However, the vaccines do not protect against all of the strains of this bacterium, and it may only offer protection for five to eight years.

                A fever, flu-like symptoms, and a quickly developing rash can also be caused by other medical conditions, including inflammation of the blood vessels after a viral infection. Also, a similar-looking rash that usually develops more slowly and without a fever or other symptoms could be due to a reduced number of platelets in the blood. The child is at risk of severe bleeding, for instance a brain hemorrhage. (See Appendix D, for tips on using a thermometer.)
