                Patients generally consider dental care only for cosmetic reasons, thinking it unessential for
                maintaining good health. It can be expensive, so it is often at the bottom of their priority list.
                Thousands of people go about their business not realizing that the poor state of their gums is risking
                the overall health of their body.

                It is a fact that everybody’s mouth houses bacteria (germs) that enter your bloodstream when your gums
                are manipulated. The body’s natural defenses can often kill these bacteria when they enter the
                bloodstream. However, the germs occasionally survive and can infect heart valves that have been infected
                in the past, or can damage artificial heart valves. In addition, the condition of having chronically
                infected gums (periodontal disease) may contribute to damage to the internal lining of your coronary
                arteries (small blood vessels supplying nourishment to the heart) such that it leads to a heart attack.

                Usually when you visit the dentist for some sort of procedure, you will be asked if you have a history
                of having an infected heart valve, have an artificial heart valve, etc. If you do, you are at increased
                risk, and may be given an antibiotic to prevent infecting your heart valve before starting dental
                treatment. However, recent studies indicate that people with chronically infected gums may continually
                be at a higher risk of a heart attack.

                The important message to the general public is to get regular checkups by the dentist so that gum
                disease can be properly diagnosed and treated. Routinely brush and floss your teeth. Ask your dentist or
                dental hygienist to show you how to properly use a toothbrush and dental floss. Make proper dental care
                a priority.
