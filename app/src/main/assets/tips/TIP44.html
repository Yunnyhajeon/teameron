            Gradually increasing pain in the back of the neck or lower back over a period of several days, often
            accompanied by night sweats and a low-grade fever, may be caused by a serious infection. The pain may extend
            from the neck into an arm or from the lower back into a leg, followed by sudden weakness in that arm or leg.
            This requires emergency evaluation. You may have an epidural or intraspinal abscess. Seek medical care
            immediately.

                An epidural or intraspinal abscess is an infection that occurs within the confines of the spinal canal,
                a space surrounded by the bone of the vertebrae extending from the head to the tailbone. This space
                contains the spinal cord.

                Bacteria can enter the spinal canal via the bloodstream from a site elsewhere in the body, often the
                gums of the mouth or a skin infection. After gaining entrance to the spinal canal, the bacteria
                establish an infection in the wall of the canal. The body defenses react by walling off the infection
                and forming an abscess. The abscess rises like a boil, putting pressure on the spinal cord. First an arm
                or leg becomes weak, and then additional pressure may lead to a loss of function of the spinal cord and
                paralysis of all muscles below the level of pressure. An abscess in the neck area can paralyze both arms
                and legs. If it is in the lower back, it can paralyze both legs. Early treatment is essential to avoid
                permanent paralysis.

                Take no chances. If you develop these symptoms, call 911 or have someone take you to an emergency room
                immediately.
