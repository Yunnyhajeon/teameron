            A lump found in the thyroid gland, at the front base of the neck (under the “Adam’s apple” in men), may be
            cancerous.

                If you detect an enlargement or lump at the front base of your neck, make an appointment with your
                doctor as soon as possible for testing and treatment. When your thyroid gland is larger than normal, you
                have a goiter. The three basic kinds of enlargement are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A general enlargement of the entire gland, often caused by a disorder of the immune system. It
                        can also be caused by a deficiency of iodine (which is rare).</li>
                    <li>A lumpy enlargement of the entire gland, which is usually harmless but may eventually lead to
                        decreased gland function. Cancer is occasionally found in part of the gland.</li>
                    <li>A single lump in the gland, which may be cancerous. Thyroid cancer can often be cured with
                        treatment.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Any abnormality in the thyroid gland needs to be evaluated by a physician. (Also see Appendix C, page
                371, for information about thyroid screening.)
