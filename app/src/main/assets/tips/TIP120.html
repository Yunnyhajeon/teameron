            If you develop a change in your bowel habits (excluding a short episode of diarrhea) or begin to pass pencil-size stools, then you need to be evaluated. It could be an early sign of colon cancer. Other diseases affecting the intestines may also cause these warning signals.

                The pattern of bowel movement frequency is an individual trait. Some people have a bowel movement every day, while others have one every other day or every third day. While any of these patterns may be normal for you, an important warning signal is when the pattern of your bowel movements suddenly changes. This is true whether they become more frequent or less frequent: It means that something is disturbing the normal function of the colon. In serious cases, that something could be cancer.

                Another warning signal is a change in the diameter of the bowel movement. Usually the diameter of the formed stool that is passed reflects the diameter of the colon. A narrowing of the colon brought on by a constricting growth such as cancer may cause the stool to become consistently narrow in diameter.

                Since early evaluation increases the chance of a cure for colon cancer or other diseases of the intestines, being sensitive to such minor changes in your bodyâ€™s function may save your life. When these occur, see your doctor. (See Appendix C, page 374, about early detection of cancer in the GI tract.)
