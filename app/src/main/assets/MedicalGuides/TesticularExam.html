            <p>
                Many doctors recommend examining your testicles at least once a month beginning at puberty (see Figure 20). Performing regular testicular exams will help you become familiar with what is normal, and may help you detect a mass early. This should be in addition to, not as a replacement for, the testicular exam performed by your doctor as part of your routine cancer-related checkup (especially between the ages of fourteen to thirty-five). The doctor may discover an abnormality you might miss. Early detection and treatment of cancer may lead to a cure.

            <p>
                The following are the current guidelines for examining your testicles:
            </p>

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>During or after a warm bath or shower is the best time to perform the self-exam.</li>
                <li>Separately examine each testicle, holding the penis out of the way.</li>
                <li>Holding the testicle between your thumb and two fingers, roll it gently between your fingers. A normal testicle is smooth and round and feels like a hard-boiled egg. Each should move freely in your scrotal sac.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
