            How do you know how serious a head injury is? One that causes nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, mental confusion, or any loss of consciousness requires immediate medical evaluation. Always examine the injured person for paralysis or weakness in any part of the body, unequal pupil dilation, slurred speech, personality changes, convulsions, restlessness, clumsiness, severe headache, neck pain and/or a stiff neck (do not move the neck to test the degree of stiffness), and/or any sensory impairment (blurred vision, hearing loss, etc.). These symptoms denote a medical emergency. If any of these symptoms occur within minutes, hours, or days after a head injury, it is a medical emergency.

            <p>
                Before discussing the specific symptoms you should watch out for after you or someone else has experienced a head injury, you need to be aware of the following things that you should never do after a head injury:
                <ul>
                    <li>Do not move the injured person unless it’s absolutely necessary.</li>
                    <li>Do not let the injured person move, get up, or walk around; wait for EMS to arrive.</li>
                    <li>Do not wash a deep or heavily bleeding head wound.</li>
                    <li>Do not remove any object that is sticking out of a wound.</li>
                    <li>Do not shake the person if they seem dazed.</li>
                    <li>Do not remove a helmet if a head injury is suspected (unless it is necessary because they need CPR).</li>
                    <li>Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take a sedative or strong pain medication for at least forty-eight hours after a head injury.</li>
                    <li>Do not take aspirin after a head injury, as it can increase the risk of bleeding. Over-the-counter pain medicine such as acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol) may be used for a mild headache if you do not have liver disease or drink alcohol excessively.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, turning to the symptoms—the following categories of symptoms are all definite warning signs that the injured person needs immediate emergency medical evaluation.
                <ul>
                    <li>Any moderate to severe bleeding from the head or face, swelling at the site of the injury, or facial bruising requires emergency treatment. Call 911 and stop the bleeding by wrapping gauze or a clean cloth snugly around the head to cover the wounded area. If blood soaks through, do not remove the cloth, but place another cloth over the first one. Since there may be a skull fracture, do not apply direct pressure to the bleeding site unless the bleeding is so severe that the person may die from blood loss. Direct pressure may damage the brain. Do not remove any debris from the wound. Apply ice packs to any swollen areas.</li>
                    <li>Someone who develops symptoms such as nausea, drowsiness, slurred speech, mental confusion, or loss of consciousness even for a short period of time following a head injury needs immediate medical evaluation and close observation. Note: Any loss of consciousness after a blow to the head indicates a concussion, which is caused by the abrupt movement of the brain inside the skull. These symptoms may indicate anything from a mild injury with the temporary loss of brain function to a more serious injury with permanent brain damage.</li>
                    <li>Someone who experiences prolonged  unconsciousness after a head injury has sustained a more serious injury to the brain, which may include hemorrhage into the brain, blood compressing the brain, swelling of the brain, or spinal cord injury. These are real medical emergencies, and the unconscious person needs special treatment until emergency care arrives. Some tips to prevent further damage to the unconscious person are as follows:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never move the person’s head or neck! Keep their head and neck immobilized until medical personnel arrive. If the person has sustained spinal cord damage, moving the head may worsen the damage or may even be fatal.</li>
                        <li>When someone is vomiting, you may need to gently turn his or her whole body to the side to stop the fluid from getting into the lungs. In this situation the head and shoulders must be moved in the same direction at the same time. This is most easily done if you get another person to assist with the head as you roll the body. This maneuver is called a “log roll.”</li>
                        <li>Watch the airway of the unconscious person, because he or she may develop airway obstruction and even stop breathing. Open the mouth of the injured person and look for food or fluid that may be blocking the airway. This material should be removed very carefully with your fingers. If the person is still not breathing, administer CPR (see Appendix A).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Unequal pupils and weakness in an arm or leg are very important observations, even if the person’s mental status has not changed. Since these symptoms may indicate complications of the head injury, they constitute a true emergency.</li>
                    <li>Someone who appears to be okay shortly after a head injury may still be in danger. He or she may develop symptoms hours, days, or even months later. When this occurs, failure to obtain emergency treatment can be fatal. Be vigilant and on the alert for the person who becomes nauseated, very drowsy, and/or confused following a head injury, even if it seems that these symptoms are unrelated to the earlier injury.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the above red light warning signals may indicate bleeding and/or swelling in the brain or around the brain, requiring emergency medical intervention. A person is at a higher risk for these types of complications (even if the head injury is relatively minor) if he or she is over the age of 65, is on blood thinners such as aspirin, plavix, and coumadin, and/or has liver disease from chronic alcohol consumption—all of which increase the risk of excessive bleeding.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the injured person is sent home rather than admitted to the hospital, and they go to sleep, ensure that their condition is stable by awakening them every hour for the first six hours after the injury to make certain they have not gone into an unconscious state. Then check them for consciousness every four hours for the next eighteen hours after the injury. Observe them closely for two or three days following the injury.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            If a person becomes loud, abusive, combative, or profane after a head injury, he or she may have a significant brain injury and is in need of emergency medical evaluation.
        </div>
        
        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you observe someone acting combative or abusive after a head injury, get that person to a doctor as soon as possible, because he or she may have a significant brain injury. A helper who does not realize that this behavior is due to brain injury may think the person is drunk, taking illegal drugs, or just rude. It is very important that combative behavior be recognized as a possible red light warning signal, as it may be the only indicator of brain damage that is getting worse. (See Tip 16 for other causes of a sudden change in personality.)
