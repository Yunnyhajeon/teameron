            If you have a smokersâ€™ cough, you are at much higher risk of developing a serious lung infection.

                Tobacco smoke irritates the entire respiratory system, including the nose, sinuses, throat, windpipe, and lungs. This irritation injures the surface of these areas, reducing their ability to remove mucous secretions and defend themselves against germ invasion. These changes lead to more frequent infections of the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. Damage to the mucous lining causes persistent congestion and coughing, which is a prime setup for developing pneumonia. A chronic cough may hide a lung infection or other serious lung ailment.

                To reduce your risk of developing serious infections, stop smoking. You will also feel better.
