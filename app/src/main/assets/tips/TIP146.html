                Believe it or not, there are more germs in a human mouth than that of a dog. If someoneâ€™s teeth go through your skin, even if it is a shallow cut on your hand from punching their mouth, watch out. The wound may look fine for the first forty-eight hours, only to develop redness and swelling later on, followed by pus. Immediate antiseptic cleansing and the removal of the damaged tissue from the wound as soon as possible by a health professional can often prevent the spread of infection. Also, get a tetanus shot if you have not had one in the past ten years.
