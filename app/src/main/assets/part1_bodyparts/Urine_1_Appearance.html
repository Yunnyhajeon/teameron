            Any blood in the urine, even without pain, can signify a serious problem. Even if it’s  just  one short episode and then your urine is clear, it is  very important to be  evaluated.

                The most common causes of blood in the urine—kidney stones and a bladder or prostate infection—are usually accompanied by many additional symptoms. The agonizing pain of kidney stones or the burning discomfort and urinary frequency of a bladder or prostate infection will usually get people to the doctor early. But when blood appears in your urine without accompanying pain, especially if there is only a single episode, you may take a “wait and see” attitude. This attitude may have dire consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you see blood in your urine, tell your doctor as soon as possible. There are many causes of bleeding into the urinary tract, and one of them is cancer—which may be in the kidney, the ureter, the bladder, or the prostate. When they are still small enough to be curable, these cancers may not even cause pain. Blood in the urine may be the <i>only</i> clue for an early diagnosis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other causes of blood in the urine include infections, kidney stones, kidney disease (nephritis), an enlarged prostate, certain medications, trauma, and exercise (especially biking and jogging).

            Tea-colored urine and/or yellow skin or eyes, with or without nausea and a sense of fullness, may indicate a chronic problem with gallstones. If untreated, this condition may cause liver failure, pancreatitis, bursting of the gallbladder, and/or a possible long-term risk of developing  cancer  of the gallbladder. Other possible causes of these symptoms are damaged red blood cells  and  many liver ailments, including hepatitis and cancer.

                It is natural for urine to darken in color, especially in hot weather, when the body loses fluid through sweat and the urine becomes concentrated. If the urine turns a normal color upon drinking a half gallon of water, it could be that you were just dehydrated. However, if the urine contains excess bilirubin, no amount of fluid intake will affect the color, and it will be so dark it looks like tea. Bilirubin is normally processed in the liver and turned into bile. Bile is stored in the gallbladder and flows in a tube (the bile duct) to the intestines to help digest fat.
            </p>

            <p>
                If gallstones form in the gallbladder and gain entrance to the bile duct, they often block the flow of bile to the intestines. The bile will then back up into the liver, causing inflammation. This results in a feeling of nausea and a sense of fullness. The backup of bile may also result in an accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. This yellow substance will turn your skin and eyes yellow and your urine a tea color. When the gallstone passes through the bile duct into the intestine, the urine will clear. But if another stone from the gallbladder gets stuck in the bile duct, these signs and symptoms will recur. If this continues to occur, the liver may become permanently damaged. Also, the blockage of the bile duct can cause the gallbladder to swell and rupture, resulting in toxic substances flowing into the belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another complication of gallstones can occur if a stone passes from the bile duct to a duct that is also connected to the pancreas. This tube carries very caustic digestive substances from the pancreas to the small intestines, and a backup of these substances can lead to the inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which may become fatal. (Refer to Tip 96 for more information on pancreatitis.)
            </p>

            <p>
                It should be noted that liver ailments, including hepatitis and cancer of the liver, can also cause an excess of bilirubin in the blood, causing the characteristic tea-colored urine and yellow skin and eyes. Also, as red blood cells in the bloodstream contain bilirubin, any disease or side effect of a drug that breaks up red blood cells can cause bilirubin to accumulate in the blood.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your urine turns tea-colored, or if your skin or eyes turn yellow, it is imperative that you seek medical attention.

            A rare abnormal opening between the bladder and colon or other organs can cause you to pass bubbles while you urinate. This can make it seem as if you have a sputtering urine stream, as if your urine is being fired out of a machine gun. This condition can be caused by scarring or cancer. It may lead to serious infections. There are  other causes of bubbles appearing in the urine, although in these cases, the urine appears foamy, like beer. It may be a side effect of a medication, or the result of a forceful urine stream or increased protein in the urine (proteinuria). Proteinuria can be found in people with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease.

                One of the most serious causes of “machine gun” urine flow is scarring or cancer resulting in connections (fistulas) between the bowel and the bladder. Also, these fistulas occur in persons with diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn’s disease. The bubbles are caused by gas in the bowels passing into the bladder. If you urinated in the bathtub, bubbles would come up. The urine is foul-smelling, with debris from the colon. Seek evaluation and treatment by a urologist (surgical kidney and bladder specialist) as soon as possible.
