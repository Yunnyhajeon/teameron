            Though it is rare, a child can develop acute kidney failure with a low blood count (anemia) following diarrhea or a respiratory infection. Symptoms of kidney failure include reduced urine output, red or brown urine, drowsiness, irritability, paleness, and tiny "needlepoint" red spots on the skin. Immediate medical management (ideally by a pediatric kidney specialist or nephrologist) is necessary to save the child's life in a case of acute kidney failure.
