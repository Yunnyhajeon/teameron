            Swelling, pain, and tenderness in the groin or leg may indicate the presence of blood clots, which can travel to the lungs.

                Irritation of the walls of the veins is a prime setup for blood clots, because the blood can back up in these vessels. One sign that blood clots may be forming is if the back of the lower leg often hurts and is tender to the touch. This condition is known as phlebitis, meaning “inflammation of veins.”
            </p>
<p>
                There are many causes of phlebitis, including:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>The pooling of blood in the legs along with certain dilated and damaged veins near the surface of the skin (varicose veins)</li>
<li>An injury to one of the legs</li>
<li>Sitting for long periods of time (often during a trip in a car or airplane)</li>
<li>Lying in bed for an extended period of time (being bedridden at home or in the hospital)</li>
<li>Cancer of the lung, colon, or blood, which may produce chemicals that attack the veins of the legs and cause phlebitis (this is sometimes the first indication that a cancer exists)</li>
<li>A generalized inflammation of blood vessels that develops with diseases of the connective tissue, such as lupus</li>
</ul>
<p>
                Phlebitis is potentially deadly because a large piece of the blood clot in a vein of the leg might break off and travel through the blood vessels from the leg to the lungs. A clot in the lungs produces shortness of breath and an inability to oxygenate the blood, which can be life-threatening. (See Tips 62 to 64, 81, 175, and 249.) It is therefore urgent that you see a doctor for evaluation and treatment, including a blood thinner if appropriate.
