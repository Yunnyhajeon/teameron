                Tuberculosis (TB) infections most commonly occur in the lungs but they can spread to other parts of the body. In the common course of the disease, an early cough is joined by other symptoms like weight loss, night sweats, and an overall ill feeling.

                For a while, tuberculosis seemed to be a disease of the past. Improved medications and the isolation of infected persons helped decrease the prevalence of this ailment. But stronger forms of the bacterium have caused a marked resurgence of TB. Even powerful drugs are not very effective in killing some of these new TB germs.

                TB can spread through nursing homes, attacking senior citizens, the debilitated, and AIDS patients, but in rare instances, there have been outbreaks of TB among healthy individuals. These outbreaks are more likely to occur in close quarters where air is recirculated through air-conditioning systems. People who have traveled extensively overseas are generally more likely to contract and spread TB.

                These red light signals warrant immediate evaluation by a physician. If you have tuberculosis, adhere to your medical regimen, since the disease can be fatal. In addition to tuberculosis, other possible causes of these symptoms include various infections of the lung and cancers such as lymphoma.
