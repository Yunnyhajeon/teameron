            Any woman, particularly a postmenopausal older woman, who experiences redness, itching, white patches, and/or an ulcer that does not heal in or near the genitals, should seek medical evaluation. Cancer is one possible cause of these symptoms. Cancer in this region may not appear as a growth, but as an irritated or ulcerated area.

<p>
                Thinning of the skin in the genital area occurs as a result of a decrease in the levels of the hormone estrogen and as part of the aging process. Cancer of the lips of the vulva (the outside of the vagina) usually occurs long after menopause. It is a type of skin cancer, but it may appear only as an irritated area, with or without ulceration. These red light warning signals need to be evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible. They may go unnoticed unless you see your doctor on a regular basis for checkups.
