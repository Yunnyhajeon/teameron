            A bull’s-eye red rash, with or without joint pain, could be a sign of Lyme disease from a tick bite. However, other skin conditions can also appear as red circles. Any bull’s-eye rash requires diagnosis by a physician.

                The initial event in Lyme disease is often this skin rash: a reddened area, circular in shape, with more intense redness at the center. The rash itself will clear up without treatment, but the disease will spread to other areas of the body. You may initially have flu-like symptoms and/or a fever. As the disease progresses, you may also develop joint pain, weakness, and fatigue. Eventually the brain and heart will be damaged.

            <p>
                If you have this type of rash, contact your doctor immediately. Treating Lyme disease with antibiotics during the rash phase is very effective and will usually cure it. When the infection spreads to other parts of the body, treatment becomes more complicated. Chronic Lyme disease can be a very disabling illness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although Lyme disease is not very common, it does pose a threat, especially in the Midwest and along the Atlantic coast. The tick that transmits the disease is smaller than most, so the bite often goes unnoticed.

            Rocky Mountain spotted fever is identified by a high fever and a rash that appears as little red/ purple pinpoint blood spots or splotches. The rash usually begins on the wrists and ankles or the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads over the body. It is transmitted by ticks, so you will reduce your risk if you use insect repellent and remove any ticks from your body after each day spent in the woods.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Rocky Mountain spotted fever germs gain entrance to the body through the bite of a carrier tick, and then spread throughout the body. Within fourteen days, you will develop the rash and a fever, often accompanied by weakness, chills, a headache, and a generalized flat rash. This rash has an unusual appearance and pattern that does not often occur in other acute illnesses associated with a fever. Since this disease can be fatal, immediate medical attention is necessary, even if the tick is not found. In 10 percent of cases, there is only a high fever and possibly a bad headache with no rash until it’s too late for you to be saved. If you develop an unexplained fever in the summertime, especially if you live in areas where cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are commonly reported, seek medical attention. In the United States, these include North Carolina and Oklahoma.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, ticks need time to spread disease, so check your body for ticks immediately after you return from the woods. Dousing a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and holding it over the tick will relax the creature so that you can pluck it safely off of your skin with a pair of tweezers. Make certain you remove the entire tick by placing the tweezers at the base of the head (where the neck would be) and pulling gently.

            Everyone with hives (a rash that is widespread, raised, red, swollen, intensely itchy, and may look like giant mosquito bites) ought to have at least one medical evaluation, because hives can occur with  blood cancers.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Hives are most commonly the result of a generalized allergic reaction to foods, pollen, or medication. Exposure to heat and cold, sunlight, stress, and infections can also influence the development of hives. The recurring nature of hives is the most frustrating feature. Once they appear, they may improve, only to pop out again a few days later, without any known re-exposure to the precipitating factor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Certain blood-borne and other cancers can cause hives, such as leukemia and cancer of the lymph system. Although this rarely occurs, it is advisable to check with your physician, who may do more extensive testing if he or she is suspicious that a serious condition is causing the hives (also see Tips 154, 169, and 170).
