            The red light warning signals of lower belly pain, lower back pain, and problems with urination— such as slowing of the urine flow, increased frequency, a feeling of urgency to urinate, and/or pain on urination—indicate many different possible ailments for men. Infections of the urinary tract are important to recognize early since they can cause serious kidney disease if left untreated (see Tip 130). These symptoms can also be a sign of prostatitis or, rarely, prostate cancer.
