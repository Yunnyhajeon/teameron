            Male breast enlargement commonly occurs in adolescents, obese persons, or alcohol drinkers. It can be caused by a hormonal imbalance or certain medications, but on rare occasions may be a sign of cancer in the testicles or lungs or another serious ailment. It may or may not be associated with pain.

                If you are an adult male and have noted an enlargement of your breasts, you may have a condition known as gynecomastia, which causes the breast tissue to get solid and lumpy, as opposed to the normal fat tissue near the nipples.

                Some breast enlargement may be normal, resulting from the higher levels of the hormone estrogen found in young developing boys or the decreased levels of testosterone found in some elderly men (usually due to shrunken testicles). Since the hormone testosterone counteracts the effects of estrogen, normal adult men have very little breast tissue under their nipples.

                The most common cause of abnormal breast enlargement is a side effect of medications, including diuretics, Digoxin, Dilantin, the tuberculosis drug INH, spironolactone, methadone, anticancer drugs, some antihypertensive drugs, Nizoral, Tagamet, theophylline, Zantac, and Flagyl. These drugs can upset the balance of testosterone and estrogen. If possible, you and your doctor may decide to alter your medications. The abuse of anabolic steroids, alcohol, and marijuana has also been reported to cause breast enlargement. Though rare, it can also be caused by Klinefelterâ€™s syndrome, a congenital condition that afflicts one in every five hundred men. It can lead to enlarged breast tissue and small testicles.

                Less common causes of male breast enlargement include chronic liver disease, kidney disease, breast cancer, hypothyroidism, a pituitary gland tumor, and hormone-secreting tumors in organs such as the lungs and testicles. It is important that you seek medical evaluation to determine if you have any of these underlying ailments so that early treatment can be instituted. Occasionally, no cause is found for the breast enlargement.
