A complete listing of the current vaccination schedules for all ages can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Always check this website because recommendations change. Note: Always let your health provider know of any anaphylactic (life-threatening) allergic reactions to anything before you receive a shot.

                            <li>There is now a vaccine for HPV (human papilloma virus), which is recommended in general by many medical groups for females between eleven and twenty-six years of age. However, there are other considerations that should be discussed with the doctor.</li>
                            <li>College students are required to be assessed for a number of vaccinations such as tetanus, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), varicella (chicken pox), and hepatitis B. These assessments are based on age, living situation, and—in special cases—their major. For example, a dorm-living freshman is often required to get a meningococcal vaccination, and veterinarian students are required to get vaccinated for rabies.</li>
                            <li>There are many medical organizations that recommend that you get a flu shot every year if you suffer from a chronic disease, or if you are fifty years of age or older. Women who are over three months pregnant during flu season, as well as people with babies in the home or caregivers of children, should also consider getting the flu shot. College students may benefit from a flu shot, especially if they live in a dorm. Also, people who spend a lot of time around the sick and elderly (such as caregivers and health-care workers) should get the flu vaccine.</li>
                            <li>Every older adult should talk to his or her doctor about getting pneumococcal and Herpes Zoster immunizations.</li>

                Starting at birth, it’s important for every child to be taken to his or her pediatrician or family physician for regular checkups. At their physical checkups, all kids should have their vital signs checked. They should also get their immunizations and have their growth and development tracked. Besides these routine health checks, there are a number of very important standard screenings every child should have. These include the following:
