            Shortness of breath may indicate a serious heart or lung disease or a very low blood count (anemia).

                Your lungs are like a tree whose trunk and branches are tubes filled with air (see Figure 4). At the end of each branch are many tiny “balloons.” When you inhale, the air travels from the trunk of the tree through the various branches and fills these balloons (the medical term is “alveoli”) with oxygen. When you exhale, the balloons deflate, and carbon dioxide passes through the branches, to and then through the trunk and out of your mouth and nose. Very small blood vessels, called capillaries, run near these tiny balloons. At the site where the capillaries and balloons touch one another, the red blood cells flowing through the capillaries load up with oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.

                The various causes of shortness of breath require completely different therapies. Many causes are either a result of swelling or blockage of the tubes carrying air to and from the lungs, or a result of a problem at the site where the alveoli and blood vessels exchange gases. Shortness of breath can also be the result of weakened breathing muscles or nerves. In many instances the doctor’s first step is to give you oxygen through a mask. The second step is to treat the underlying ailment.

                Many problems occur at the site of the tubes. Food can get stuck there, requiring the instant emergency measure of abdominal thrusts known as the Heimlich maneuver (see the section on choking in Appendix A, page 343). Alternatively, the tubes can swell from causes such as allergies, dust, and infections. While bronchitis (infection in the tubes) is treated with antibiotics, asthma (swelling of the tubes often caused by allergies) is treated with various medications to decrease the swelling and open the tubes.

                If the disease is at the site of the alveoli and blood vessels, other therapies may be necessary. Blood clots in the vessels require a blood thinner, whereas a shortage of red blood cells, which carry the oxygen, may mean that you need a blood transfusion. A weak heart (heart failure) may cause a backup of fluid into the lungs, which requires medication to strengthen the pumping action of the heart or to rid the body of excess fluids (a diuretic). Also, a partial or total blockage of the heart’s arteries (angina or a heart attack) can cause shortness of breath on exertion without any accompanying chest pain (see Tips 74 and 76). In this case, certain medications can be used to increase blood flow to the heart muscle, though other interventions may also be necessary to open clogged vessels. Pneumonia causes an accumulation of bacteria or viruses, white blood cells, and other by-products of infection, which clog up the vessels and alveoli. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. While viral pneumonias often resolve on their own, various supportive therapies such as oxygen or intravenous fluids may be needed. (See Tips 63, 65, 70, 72, and 248 for more on pneumonia.)

                If you are merely breathing too rapidly and your tubes, alveoli, and vessels are in good working order, you may be hyperventilating, a condition that is often brought on by some sort of distress. When you hyperventilate, you exhale too much carbon dioxide. This makes you light-headed, and even more distressed, which causes you to feel that you have to breathe even more, thus worsening your condition. Hyperventilating is associated with headache, light-headedness, blurry vision, and muscle spasms, as well as numbness and/or tingling around the mouth and hands. Many things, including frightening situations, mouth breathing, fatigue, and repeated sighs can trigger hyperventilation. Frequent sighing and yawning may be a sign of long-term hyperventilation related to underlying anxiety.

                The doctor can determine the cause of your shortness of breath by performing different procedures and tests, including listening to your lungs, checking the oxygen and red blood cell count in your blood, and taking various pictures of your lungs (X-rays, scans, etc.).
            </p>
<p>
                Since shortness of breath might be a symptom of a serious heart or lung disease, and the lack of enough oxygen can cause all the parts of your body to fail, immediate medical evaluation is appropriate.
