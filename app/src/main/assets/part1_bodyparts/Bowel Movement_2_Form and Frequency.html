            If you develop a change in your bowel habits (excluding a short episode of diarrhea) or begin to pass pencil-size stools, then you need to be evaluated. It could be an early sign of colon cancer. Other diseases affecting the intestines may also cause these warning signals.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The pattern of bowel movement frequency is an individual trait. Some people have a bowel movement every day, while others have one every other day or every third day. While any of these patterns may be normal for you, an important warning signal is when the pattern of your bowel movements suddenly changes. This is true whether they become more frequent or less frequent: It means that something is disturbing the normal function of the colon. In serious cases, that something could be cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another warning signal is a change in the diameter of the bowel movement. Usually the diameter of the formed stool that is passed reflects the diameter of the colon. A narrowing of the colon brought on by a constricting growth such as cancer may cause the stool to become consistently narrow in diameter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since early evaluation increases the chance of a cure for colon cancer or other diseases of the intestines, being sensitive to such minor changes in your body’s function may save your life. When these occur, see your doctor. (See Appendix C, page 374, about early detection of cancer in the GI tract.)

            A bout of severe or prolonged diarrhea that results in severe dehydration can be fatal.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Severe or prolonged diarrhea can cause such severe dehydration (fluid loss) and loss of essential minerals that intravenous fluids and the replacement of minerals are needed on an emergency basis. Vomiting at the same time as the bout of diarrhea puts you at an even greater risk of dehydration. Also, emergency treatment may be needed even earlier in infants, the elderly, or people with chronic heart or kidney problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sudden and severe infectious diarrhea can be caused by many different bacteria (<i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>) or by other germs called protozoans (<i>Entamoeba</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and <i>Cryptosporidia</i>). They can make you sick with profuse, possibly bloody, life-threatening diarrhea.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the most severe types of life-threatening diarrhea is called pseudomembranous colitis, which is caused by a toxin from the <i>Clostridium difficile</i> bacterium. This type of diarrhea is often thick with blood and mucus and may look as though you are shedding the lining of your colon. It can result in dehydration accompanied by extreme toxicity, and may lead to death. This condition can also be caused by an antibiotic you’ve taken for an infection someplace else in your body—it may kill the normal bacteria that live in your colon, thus promoting the growth of the bacterium that causes pseudomembranous colitis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another bacterium that causes diarrhea is <i>E. coli</i>. Epidemics caused by one of the strains of <i>E. coli</i> result from eating undercooked beef or ingesting water that has been contaminated. Also, though it is rare in the Western world, one of the most dangerous and infectious types of diarrhea is cholera. Before traveling abroad, particularly to developing countries, check with your local health department to find out about the appropriate preventive measures. Of course, if you have diarrhea and have traveled out of the country, it is very important to let your doctor know your travel history. In addition to germs, many illnesses can cause severe diarrhea.
            </p>

            <p>
                In all cases of diarrhea you can become dehydrated (feeling dizzy, weak, etc.) and lose essential minerals, such as potassium. Therefore it is always important to replenish fluids and minerals as well as to diagnose the underlying cause of the diarrhea. Diarrhea that persists, contains blood, causes weight loss, is associated with fever, and/or wakes you up at night needs to be assessed by a physician immediately. If the dehydration progresses to the point that you feel dizzy when you sit up or stand up, or urine output stops altogether, call 911 or have someone take you to an emergency room immediately for evaluation and treatment.

            Bowel movements that occur less often than every three days usually mean you are constipated. Constipation can be a sign of various diseases of the colon, including cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                After digestion is completed in the stomach and small intestine, food residues arrive in the colon. The colon is a muscular, walled tube five to six feet in length. It conserves body water by removing 90 percent of the water from the food residues (fecal material) as they pass through. If the transit time in the colon is too slow, too much water is removed, and the feces become hard. If the transit time is too fast, the fecal material will come out as diarrhea.
            </p>

            <p>
                Constipation may be caused by weak muscles in the wall of the colon. Some individuals inherit this trait, while others weaken the muscles of the colon wall by using laxatives so frequently that they become dependent on them. Many medications, including certain ones for pain and blood pressure and those containing iron, can also lead to constipation. More serious potential causes include hypothyroidism (low thyroid gland function), many diseases of the colon, and cancer, all of which need to be tested for by a doctor. Early treatment of the underlying illness can often prevent serious complications.
            </p>

            <p>
                Measures to relieve constipation are directed at improving the colon’s ability to propel material through it. For example, increased water consumption helps prevent the fecal material from becoming too hard. Stool softeners also help. Some laxatives stimulate the colon wall to squeeze fecal material through more easily, while others irritate the bowel lining, which prompts the flow of water back into the colon to aid the flow of fecal material. The latter type of laxative is less desirable because it further weakens the bowel wall. The dietary fiber present in vegetables, grain, fruits, and pectin-containing fruit juices like prune juice, or in powder supplements can help facilitate the movement of feces through the colon, as can exercise.

                If you have a bowel movement less often than every three days, or if you have experienced any change in your bowel patterns, see your doctor for an evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

            Cramping belly pain with a swollen belly, vomiting, and no bowel movement or passage of gas for more than twenty-four hours may mean that you have a life-threatening bowel blockage.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The bowel can be blocked either in the small intestine or in the large intestine. When it is blocked, fecal material and gas will back up. As the bowel attempts to force material through the blockage, you will experience severe cramping belly pain. If the location of the blockage is high up in the small bowel, vomiting will occur early on. If the blockage is low in the colon, vomiting will occur late or not at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Prior abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of bowel obstruction. Scar tissue or adhesions occur after such surgery. Often these adhesions are “bandlike,” stretching from one organ to another. These “bands” may cause entrapment of a loop of the bowel, kinking it sufficiently to block it. When left untreated, the entanglement may cut off blood circulation to the bowel wall, causing gangrene of the loop of bowel that is entrapped. If the blockage is not relieved by surgery, death can occur.
            </p>

            <p>
                Colon blockage can also be caused by cancerous growths, severe inflammation and infection of the colon, and from thick, solid, hard stools accumulating in the rectum (an impaction). Impactions are commonly treated with enemas, but if this proves unsuccessful, blockages can often be removed by a health professional sticking a gloved finger up the rectum and carefully removing the hardened stools. This condition is more common in senior citizens or dehydrated bedridden patients.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are experiencing the symptoms of bowel obstruction, you should seek immediate medical attention.
