                Menopause normally occurs in women at around the age of fifty and it signals the end of menstrual periods. Menopause happens because the ovaries run out of eggs and stop producing the estrogen necessary for menstruation. The menstrual pattern may become irregular before it stops altogether, which is called perimenopause, and it may also be accompanied by hot flashes. During a hot flash you will suddenly feel overheated and may even break out in a sweat that lasts for two to three minutes. When twelve consecutive periods are missed, you are in menopause, and any bleeding afterward is abnormal. The stage of menopause can be confirmed by certain blood studies, but it is often unnecessary to do these tests.

                    Recurrent vaginal bleeding after menopause is abnormal and may be an early warning sign of cancer, especially endometrial cancer (cancer in the lining of the womb). When this occurs, you should seek prompt medical evaluation. Early diagnosis and treatment may improve your chances of survival. Starting at age thirty-five, women who have a family history of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (a risk factor for endometrial cancer) should get annual screenings for endometrial cancer by getting an endometrial biopsy. Other risk factors for developing endometrial cancer include:
