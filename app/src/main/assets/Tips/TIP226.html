            If your child has (or at one time had) freckling and increased coloration around the mouth or anus, they may have a condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. This condition leads to multiple polyps (fingerlike growths) throughout the bowel, which may bleed, causing anemia (a low blood count) or bowel blockage.

<p>
                Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a genetic condition, has a 50 percent chance of inheritance. The affected person has increased pigmentation and freckling around the mouth and often around the anus. This pigmentation can be a telltale signal of the presence of polyps in the wall of the gut. The polyps often bleed, resulting in anemia, and may also cause intussusception (where one part of the gut telescopes into the next). These polyps usually do not turn cancerous, but the child needs to be assessed thoroughly by a gastroenterologist (stomach/ intestine specialist). (See Tip 157 for more information on this disorder.)
