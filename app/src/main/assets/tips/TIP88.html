            An electrical abnormality of the heart known as long QT syndrome can cause sudden death, especially in young adults, and even  in  children. The red light warning signals may include unexplained seizures or sudden loss of consciousness, often during physical activity such as swimming, when emotionally upset, or when startled by a noise. It’s also reported that people with long QT syndrome may experience an irregular heartbeat with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. However, it must be emphasized that these symptoms are very rarely associated with long QT syndrome and are usually related to other medical conditions.

                The long QT syndrome, a serious heart rhythm problem that occurs in young people, gets its name from the EKG readout, as the syndrome increases the distance between the Q wave and the T wave (which may only show up on an EKG during exercise or on an ambulatory heart monitor). If someone has this syndrome, he or she is at risk of developing a dangerously fast heart rate, requiring cardiac shock or medication.

                Even if you are young, if you have the above red light warning signals, it is worthwhile for you to be evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible, because it could be a warning that you have long QT syndrome. It’s very important that you get evaluated for this condition if you have a family history of drowning or of family members dying without any known cause at a young age.
