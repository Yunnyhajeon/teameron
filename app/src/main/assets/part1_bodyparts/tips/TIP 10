            How do you know how serious a head injury is? One that causes nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, mental confusion, or any loss of consciousness requires immediate medical evaluation. Always examine the injured person for paralysis or weakness in any part of the body, unequal pupil dilation, slurred speech, personality changes, convulsions, restlessness, clumsiness, severe headache, neck pain and/or a stiff neck (do not move the neck to test the degree of stiffness), and/or any sensory impairment (blurred vision, hearing loss, etc.). These symptoms denote a medical emergency. If any of these symptoms occur within minutes, hours, or days after a head injury, it is a medical emergency.
