            Name confusion seems like a silly and unlikely error, but it happens more than you might think. Don’t take chances.

                When two patients in the hospital have the same name, or even names that look similar, there is a greater chance of error. You are especially at risk if there is another patient with the same name or a similar name in the treatment area (hospital floor) where you are located.
            </p>
                How do you find out if this is the case during your hospital stay? Simply ask the nurse who is caring for you. If the answer is yes, then ask if the hospital has a system for alerting staff members to the coincidence of two patients having similar names. If they don’t, then request special identifiers such as name alerts (which are often either stickers on written charts or red labels on electronic files). In certain cases, it might even be wise to ask to be moved to another area of the hospital. If the nursing staff refuses to cooperate, notify the CEO’s office. There are strict patient privacy rules, but you don’t need to know the identity of the other person to prevent a situation of name confusion. All you need to do is request that the increased risk be addressed.

            Correct identity is essential; make sure you are accurately identified before any treatment is initiated.

                Check your armband to be certain that it’s your name printed on it. You should also look for your correct birthdate printed on the armband. It is required that every health-care provider obtain two sources of identification prior to treating you, usually by checking your armband and by asking you your name. Make certain they do this and ask for an explanation if they do not.

                Miscommunication among physicians, nurses, and hospital personnel is a major cause of medical errors. Ask your doctor what his/her schedule is and which doctor covers for him/her on off hours. Make sure that all of the doctors who are caring for you know why you are in the hospital, as well as what your diagnostic and treatment plans are, particularly during the next twenty-four hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you are taken from your hospital room, make sure to ask where you’re being taken and why. When you arrive at another location, ask what is to be done. Make sure all the answers from the different practitioners are consistent. Also, upon any visit to the ER, make sure that your own medical specialist(s) is contacted and advised or consulted with if you have a past medical history relating to your current condition.

                Make sure that your surgeon marks the appropriate surgery site on your body before you are taken to the operating room. Make certain that the area is marked while you are awake and cognizant of what he or she is doing. You know what needs to be done; make certain everybody else does.
