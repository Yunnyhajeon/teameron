            Does your child have five or more flat light brown birthmarks (each more than three quarters of an inch or 1.5 centimeters in diameter)? If so, they should be examined by an expert to exclude neurofibromatosis, an inheritable condition that may be associated with learning disabilities, epilepsy, and a high risk of malignant tumors.

                Neurofibromatosis is an inherited condition that occurs in 1 child per 2,500. It is very variable in its manifestations. A child who has one or more of the following should be assessed by an expert:
                <ul>
<li>Five or more “café au lait” spots (light brown, flat moles) on the skin (each measuring over 1.5 centimeters or three quarters of an inch in diameter). They are most commonly found on the trunk of the body, and are usually not present at birth but appear in the first two decades of life.</li>
<li>Freckling in the armpits and/or groin</li>
<li>Plexiform neurofibroma, a lumpy overgrowth of parts of peripheral nerves, most common on the jaw and eyelids</li>
<li>Fibromas, or small, pink, non-painful lumpy growths on the skin that do not occur until puberty</li>
<li>Speckling on the iris of the eyes</li>
<li>Scoliosis or bowing of the legs</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                Adults may have neurofibromatosis but be unaware of it. Affected children may experience neurological problems during infancy, such as epilepsy, attention deficit disorder, and mental retardation. Those affected are at a high risk of developing tumors of the optic nerve (the nerve to the eye), the main nerve to the ear, and the brain. A precise diagnosis is especially important, since the family should seek genetic consulting.
