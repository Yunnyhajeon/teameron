            If you have had a draining sore for months, and it will not heal—particularly if it is on your neck (usually around the angle of the jaw), your forearm, or your foot—you may have a serious body-invading fungus infection. There are many other treatable causes of nonhealing sores that also require immediate medical evaluation and treatment, such as scrofula, which is a cousin of tuberculosis.

                Fungus infections are always life-threatening in anyone who has an impaired immune system. Most of them are limited to the skin and nails, but some can invade the body and spread to the internal organs. It is important to see your doctor as soon as possible for tests on the material draining from the wound so that early treatment can be instituted. Note: The most common presentation of a fungus infection is generally a rash, but the type of deep draining sore that is described above is more common in people with impaired immune systems.

                Yeast infections are also fungal. They are usually confined to the vagina, around the corners of the mouth, or in the mouth. A life-threatening blood-borne yeast infection is more common in patients with poor defense mechanisms, including people with AIDS, people who are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, and people taking steroids and other drugs after receiving an organ transplant. Yeast infections are usually responsive to antifungal agents.
