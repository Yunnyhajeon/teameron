            Passing out or nearly passing out, with the feeling of light-headedness when you sit up or try to stand, is often the result of a drop in blood pressure  (orthostatic  hypotension).  The potentially life-threatening causes of this condition include internal hemorrhage, serious heart irregularities, and severe dehydration. These symptoms can also occur as side effects of certain medications.
