            If your child has become suddenly ill and is drooling, is unable to open his or her mouth wide, has any decrease in the range of motion in his or her neck, cannot swallow liquids (including his/her own saliva), and/or is having difficulty talking or breathing, take your child to the emergency room immediately. Swelling, possibly caused by an infection, could be blocking the child's throat. Another sign that this is the case is if the child refuses to assume any position besides sitting up and forward. Try to keep the child upright.
