            In women, senior citizens, and diabetics a general sense of weakness and/or shortness of breath without any chest pain may be the only warning sign of a heart attack.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The pain of a heart attack usually occurs in the center of the chest, under the breastbone or in the front-left breast area. The pain is most often a sensation of pressure, like a heavy weight on the chest or a squeezing tightness. Profound weak- ness often accompanies the pain. A cold and clammy sweat may be present, with nausea and vomiting. In some cases, however, a heart attack may occur in an entirely atypical manner.
            </p>

            <p>
               If you are a woman, senior citizen, or diabetic, be aware that shortness of breath and/or profound weakness may be the only signs of a “silent” heart attack. Consult your physician immediately for an evaluation, which includes an EKG, blood tests of certain heart chemicals, and special X-rays of the heart, to determine if you are having a heart attack. Life saving treatments may be necessary.

            Severe constipation, dehydration, muscle weak- ness, bone pain, loss of memory, confusion, de- pression, psychosis (loss of contact with reality), anxiety, heart rhythm abnormalities, and kidney stones are all symptoms that may indicate an overactive parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism). There may also be other general symptoms such as increased thirst and urination, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and/or abdominal pain (gastric ulcers).        
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The parathyroid glands (there are usually four) are located in the front base of the neck, near the thyroid gland. These small glands produce a hormone that controls the amount of calcium in your blood. If one of the glands develops a growth, or gets larger than normal, the hormonal output is increased, causing the amount of calcium (stored primarily in the bones) to increase in the bloodstream.
            </p>

            <p>
                A high level of calcium in the blood increases the risk of developing the above symptoms and ailments. In addition to these, it can cause a loss of calcium from the bones that will result in softening of the bones, and thus bone pain. The life-threatening consequences of high calcium include abnormal heart rhythms and severe dehydration.
            </p>

            <p>           
                Tumors or growths of the parathyroid glands are rarely large enough to be felt by examining the neck, so you have to rely on appropriate blood studies to provide evidence that they are present.
            </p>

            <p>
                Surgical removal of a diseased parathyroid gland is usually curative. Preservation of the remaining glands is important since without them and the hormone they produce, the blood calcium level would drop too low, causing seizures and muscle spasms. This condition could even be life-threatening.
            </p>

            <p>
                The symptoms of an overactive parathyroid gland can be subtle and slowly creep up on you. If you notice these symptoms, notify your doctor for an evaluation as soon as possible.
