            If you experience upper-middle belly pain (with or without vomiting blood and/or passing black tarry stools), you may have an ulcer or inflammation in the stomach and/or an ulcer in the duodenum. Drinking alcohol may increase the risk of developing ulcers and also prevent the healing of ulcers that are already present. It can also make pancreatitis worse, increasing the possibility of fatal complications.

<p>
                Alcohol is rapidly absorbed through the stomach lining and causes acid and enzymes to pour into the stomach in large volumes. The presence of excess amounts of these chemicals can lead to inflammation of the stomach, the formation of ulcers, and/or progression of ulcers already present.
            </p>
<p>
                When ulcers or inflammation of the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) are a problem, abstinence from drinking is important. Alcohol may relieve the belly pain momentarily, but the condition will eventually worsen because alcohol consumption increases the risk that the ulcer will bleed and/or perforate in the abdominal cavity. Black tarry stools are often a sign of ulcers bleeding into the stomach or intestines.
            </p>

                Belly pain associated with pancreatitis from alcohol intake is potentially life-threatening. The pancreas, located in the upper belly, produces insulin to control blood sugar and the very caustic chemicals (or enzymes) that help in food digestion. When pancreatitis occurs, the substances that digest food begin to digest the pancreas itself. These caustic chemicals may also be released into the bloodstream with life-threatening consequences.
            </p>

                If you drink a large quantity of alcohol and suddenly develop nausea, vomiting, and severe belly pain, you are at risk of tearing the inside of your esophagus. This can cause severe bleeding and dehydration. Seek medical care to evaluate and treat this ailment and to get advice on how to stop drinking.
            </p>

                Belly pain with bleeding—vomiting blood or excreting black tarry stools—requires emergency medical care. (See Tip 125 for more information on black tarry stools and life-threatening bleeds.) Upper-middle and/or upper-left belly pain that extends to the back can be a sign of pancreatitis and also requires emergency medical care. (See Tip 96 for more information on pancreatitis.)

                Note: The combination of drinking alcohol and smoking puts you at a much greater risk of developing these problems.
