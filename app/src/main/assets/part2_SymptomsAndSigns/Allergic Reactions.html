            A serious, life-threatening allergic reaction, especially starting with a swollen, tingling, or numb tongue, lips, and/or throat and breathing problems may progress rapidly, becoming fatal within minutes. Hives and/or itching may also occur in the upper body. The allergic reaction can be reversed if medical treatment is started immediately.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Allergic reactions are common. They can follow exposure to just about anything, but they usually occur from foods, certain plants, bee stings, or medicines. They are not dose-related— you can have a serious reaction following even a tiny exposure. And you can also develop allergic reactions to things you were not allergic to in the past.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most allergic reactions result only in an itchy rash and swelling. Occasionally the swelling will become severe when it occurs in locations where there is loose skin, like the area around your eyes or groin. This massive swelling looks bad but is generally not dangerous; it responds well to medical treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, however, allergic reactions occur very rapidly and become life-threatening. The main cause of death in these cases is an inability to breathe, because severe swelling has blocked the airways. In addition, there is a collapse in blood pressure from the sudden dilation (expansion) of blood vessels throughout the body. If you exhibit the following symptoms within thirty minutes of exposure to an allergen, then you are in danger of a full-blown allergic reaction and need to get to an emergency room immediately, or need to receive an epinephrine shot on the spot:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swelling of the tongue and mouth</li>
                    <li>Hoarseness, a “lump in the throat” feeling, difficulty swallowing</li>
                    <li>Breathing problems, a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and croup</li>
                    <li>Dizziness, with a cold sweat and/or profuse sweating</li>
                    <li>A pale or blue appearance</li>
                    <li>Abdominal cramps and/or vomiting</li>
                    <li>A loss of consciousness</li>
                </ul>  
            
            <p>
                Be prepared! If you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past, it may be worse next time. Know the early symptoms of a severe allergy attack so that you can tell if you need immediate life-saving medical treatment. Also, ask your doctor for a home epinephrine kit—it contains a single shot of the drug epinephrine, which you can inject into your muscle. This medicine opens your airways and tightens your blood vessels, thus saving your life. However, the effects of the shot wear off within a few hours, and you will need to be admitted to an emergency room for observation and/or further treatment.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To prevent allergic reactions, you need to first become familiar with your allergies. Make a record of all allergic reactions you have experienced and what caused them. The following are some of the most common substances to which people are allergic (called allergens):
            </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Foods:</b> shellfish, soybeans, nuts, milk, eggs, MSG, sulfites</li>
                    <li><b>Insect bites:</b> bees, wasps, ants</li>
                    <li><b>Drugs:</b> penicillin (most common), aspirin, sulfa-based drugs, ibuprofen or other non-aspirin pain medicine</li>
                    <li><b>Radiographic contrast material:</b> the fluid injected into you during a study such as a CT scan (a special computerized X-ray), an IVP (a special X-ray of your kidneys), angiography (special X-ray study of your arteries), etc.</li>
                </ul>  
            
            <p>
                An allergist is a medical specialist who can help you identify your specific allergies and teach you how you can avoid exposure to them. (In some cases he or she may recommend that you begin getting weekly allergy shots that will help immunize you to your allergies.) Inform any doctors and medical staff involved in your care of all of your allergies, especially if you are allergic to any medications or to the contrast material injected into you during X-ray procedures. Consider purchasing an engraved bracelet listing your allergens; your pharmacist should know where you can obtain one. This may be useful in emergency situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a rare but potentially fatal ailment called angioedema that presents itself similarly to an allergic reaction. The red light warning signal of this condition is the isolated and painless swelling of a random body part—the tongue, the mouth, a hand or a foot, et cetera—without itching. People who have angioedema can spontaneously develop swelling in the windpipe, cutting off their air supply. These swellings are rare and often occur for no known reason, though they have been occasionally associated with high blood pressure and heart medications known as ACE inhibitors (check with your pharmacist or doctor to determine if any of the medications you are taking fall into this category). Urgent evaluation and treatment of this type of swelling is necessary. (See Tips 170 and 171 about allergies to medications. See Tip 231 for more information on allergies in children.)

        <div class="tip_contents">
            Allergic reactions to medication commonly occur in the form of a rash or an upset stomach. Other symptoms include a low-grade fever, aching joints and muscles, and a sore mouth and tongue. Though rare, life-threatening reactions may occur.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                People can have reactions to both prescription and over-the-counter medications, including headache pills, aspirin, laxatives, and sinus pills.
            </p>

            <p>
                Severe allergic reactions to medications are rare, and they usually only occur immediately after starting (or restarting) a medication. In life-threatening situations associated with weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, vomiting, and/or dizziness, emergency epinephrine shots are necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                A skin rash is one of the most common reactions to medication. This type of rash is generally very itchy, and its appearance will vary from patches of small red bumps to hives. It may occur anywhere on the body. It will usually not result in serious complications if the offending medication is stopped soon after the symptoms appear. Contact your doctor immediately so he/she can decide whether it is safe for you to stop the medication and start alternative treatment. Besides helping you to control the situation (and prevent future allergic reactions), he or she can also prescribe treatments to alleviate the rash.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, while rashes are a common side effect, there are many other possible reactions. For example, another common one is a sore tongue or mouth. Anytime this occurs, it should be considered a reaction to a medication until proven other- wise.
            </p>

            <p>
                You may also experience stomach irritation in reaction to a medication. This is quite common with over-the-counter pain medicines. Make sure you notify your doctor immediately and stop the medicine, because stomach ulceration can occur and may lead to a life-threatening hemorrhage. (For more on ulcers caused by medication see Tip 100.)
            </p>

            <p>
                In some cases, symptoms of an allergy to medication may be quite vague, including fatigue, a low-grade fever, and aching all over the body. It may seem like the flu, but if your condition gets worse after a week, it is time to go back to the doctor, because you may have developed a severe toxic effect from the medication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many medications can also ultimately cause a severe inflammatory reaction in the kidneys or liver, which could result in kidney failure and/or chemical hepatitis. It is prudent to be on the lookout for this phenomenon when starting a new medication. Always consult your physician immediately if you think a medication is causing any of these reactions.
            </p>

            <p>
                To further protect yourself, avoid the following bad combinations of these common medications. Do not take any ibuprofen (Advil) if you are currently taking an NSAID [Daypro, Indocin, Ketoprofen, ketorolac (Toradol), meloxicam (Mobic), naprosyn (Aleve)], or if you are on blood thinners, such as Coumadin. Do not take any aspirin while taking Coumadin without first checking with your doctor. Note: In certain cases, low-dose aspirin (81 mgs) can be taken with Coumadin. In addition, review the package insert available from your pharmacist for information on side effects and drug interactions relating to all of the medications you are taking.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            On rare occasions certain medications can cause fatal reactions, starting with a rash with targetlike lesions. This distinctive symptom is usually accompanied by sores in the mouth, nose, eyes, anus, and/or genital region, and a low-grade fever. Though extremely dangerous, this condition is treatable and curable if caught early.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                This condition is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and it can cause a severe allergic reaction that may damage a large area of the skin, causing it to blister and slough off. When this condition develops, seizures, coma, and death can follow, so early diagnosis and treatment are essential. If you develop a rash after starting a medication, get in touch with a doctor (preferably your own physician) immediately.

            Weakness and/or tingling sensations in the legs, which usually progresses to the arms and upper body and causes breathing difficulties, may ultimately lead to paralysis and death. This rare ailment, known as Guillain-Barré syndrome, sometimes follows certain infections, vaccinations, or surgeries.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                When Guillain-Barré syndrome develops, the body’s immune system begins to attack its own nerves. The syndrome eventually interrupts the transmission of nerve impulses to the areas of the body controlled by these nerves. This will gradually result in the onset of paralysis in the legs (usually starting from the toes and moving up the body), accompanied by an increased difficulty in breathing. Death may occur if medical treatment is not instituted.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most people recover with proper treatment, but rehabilitation is lengthy. One form of treatment is plasma-pheresis, a process that cleans the blood of bound antibodies causing these nerve problems. High-dose immunoglobulin therapy (administering proteins that normally attack invading germs) can also help. If this latter procedure is done before the muscles for breathing are affected, it may prevent you from being put on a ventilator.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome occur, see your doctor immediately, or get to an emergency room.
