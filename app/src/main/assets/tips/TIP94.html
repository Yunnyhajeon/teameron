            Agonizing belly pain that worsens with any movement, accompanied by rigid belly muscles, especially in a person with a history of ulcers of  the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), is often a sign of a perforated ulcer.

                Ulcer problems have a reputation for being long-standing, with frequent bouts of belly discomfort, including pain, indigestion, a feeling of fullness, nausea, and other symptoms. If you have ulcers, you may have gotten used to this discomfort by intermittently taking pills during severe bouts of pain.

                This situation sets the stage for the ulcer to progress, eroding deeper and deeper into the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine, just below the stomach), until a hole is formed. When this perforation occurs, stomach contents are released into the belly cavity along with gas or air. Severe internal bleeding may also occur. This causes immediate, agonizing abdominal pain that worsens with any movement. Also, you may experience abdominal muscle spasms: The stomach contents will cause intense tissue reaction in the belly lining, resulting in a reflex belly muscle spasm with board-like muscle rigidity. The belly area will thus feel like a solid board instead of soft to the touch.

                This condition requires immediate medical attention at an emergency room.
