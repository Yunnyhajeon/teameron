            If you have long-term heartburn and belching  that does not respond to an antacid or ulcer medication, it can lead to ulcers, bleeding, and/or narrowing of the esophagus (which may predispose you to cancer).

                The tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach is called the esophagus. When food backs up from the stomach into the esophagus (reflux) and the esophagus becomes irritated, you may develop heartburn. This condition often responds to an antacid or ulcer medication. However, if you have heartburn for weeks and it does not respond to conventional treatment, it is important to have it evaluated by your doctor.
