                            <li>The amount of activity or emotional stress, as well as the amount of clothing and the temperature of a child’s environment, can influence his/her body temperature.</li>
                            <li>When reporting a fever to the doctor, always tell him/ her where on the body the temperature was taken, and the exact number of the reading.</li>
                            <li>To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 and divide by 1.8. To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8 and add 32.</li>

            <h3>What Kind of Thermometer to Use</h3>

            <div class="body_contents">

            <p>
                Most standard digital thermometers can be used either orally, rectally, or under the arm (for an axillary temperature). There are also digital thermometers that are designed for taking temperatures in other specific locations, such as the ear or the forehead. However, these specialized thermometers may not be as widely available and may cost more than a standard digital thermometer.
            </p>
            <p>

Digital thermometers are easier to read and take a much shorter time to register a temperature than glass thermometers. They are also generally considered safer to use than glass thermometers. If a glass thermometer breaks, there is the danger of broken glass as well as the possible danger of mercury poisoning. However, if you do plan on taking a rectal temperature with a glass thermometer, make sure that the thermometer is one designed specifically for taking a rectal temperature—it should have a round bulb at the tip so that it won’t be sharp against the walls of the rectum. The bulb on the glass oral thermometer is long and thin. Either one of these types of glass thermometers can also be used for an axillary (under the arm) temperature.

<p><b>Rectal</b></p>
<p>
Most emergency room doctors recommend taking a rectal temperature in a young child, especially under six months of age, and ideally up to two years of age, because it gives the most accurate measurement. Taking an axillary temperature might be easier for some
