            Prolonged failure to menstruate in the absence of pregnancy usually means failure of one of the glands or the part of the brain involved in providing a normal menstrual cycle. It is important to determine if there is a serious underlying cause.

                When an egg bursts from the ovary (ovulation), it leaves behind a remnant of the egg that produces hormones. These hormones make the lining of the uterus grow, preparing it to accept the fertilized egg. If fertilization does not occur, the lining of the uterus is shed via menstruation, and the cycle begins again. The menstrual flow consists of the shedding of the lining of the uterus (womb) mixed with blood. If any of the above events fail to take place, then the lining of the uterus will not grow, it will not be cast off, and there will be no period or menstruation.

                Glands other than the ovaries are also involved in providing a normal menstrual cycle. The failure or abnormal function of these glands can cause missed periods, obesity, hair on the face, and acne. Prolonged failure to menstruate may be a sign that serious gland problems exist. Menstrual periods can be reinstituted with birth control pills, but it is still important to determine the underlying cause so that it can be treated.

                Other hormone problems (such as excess estrogen) can also lead to a lack of ovulation. In this case the lining of the uterus will grow, but there will be no shedding or menstruation. Accumulation of the lining of the uterus may lead to a cancerous growth as early as six months after you start missing periods. It is also a common cause of infertility.

                Keep in mind that you can fail to menstruate, have a negative pregnancy test, and still have an ectopic pregnancy. (See Tip 192.)

                Prolonged failure to menstruate without pregnancy requires timely medical evaluation. Also, girls over the age of fifteen who have never had a menstrual period should be evaluated to determine the underlying cause and to implement appropriate therapy.
