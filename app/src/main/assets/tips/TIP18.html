            If your eyelids droop part of the time and you have double vision, or your jaw gets tired while chewing, you may have a serious neurological problem called myasthenia gravis.

                Do people ask, “Why don’t you open your eyes all the way? You look like you’re sleepy”? Does your jaw get so tired at times when you are eating that you can’t take another bite? If you have droopy eyelids, a weary jaw, difficulty swallowing, and/or general weakness, especially as the day progresses, you may have a potentially serious nerve disorder called myasthenia gravis.

                With myasthenia gravis there is a blockage of the chemical that is needed for sending messages through your nerves to certain muscles in your body, and only a weakened nerve signal gets through. Weakened muscles make it hard to chew and cause your eyelids to droop. Other muscles, including breathing muscles, may also become weak. The weakness usually worsens with prolonged use of the muscle groups in question, and is often referred to as “fatigable weakness.” If this ailment is left untreated, it could be fatal since you could stop breathing. Effective medications can control myasthenia gravis, so if you experience these red light warning signals, see your doctor as soon as possible.
