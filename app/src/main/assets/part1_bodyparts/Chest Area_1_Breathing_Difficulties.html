            Difficulty breathing and a wheezing sound while breathing, often following physical exertion, are signs of an asthma attack. Left untreated, an asthma attack can lead to severe chest muscle fatigue and death.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                How do you know when an asthma attack is life-threatening? The most important consideration is how long it lasts. Since asthma makes breathing difficult, it requires much more energy to draw each breath, leading to fatigue. As the attack goes on, you will become increasingly tired, and your condition will thus become more life-threatening. During an attack, as the muscles for breathing become tired, the volume of air exchanged by the lungs will decrease. This decrease may be so subtle that you will hardly notice it. The result will be a drop in the oxygen level, accompanied by a rise in the carbon dioxide level in the blood.
            </p>

            <p>
                Carbon dioxide is a by-product of body metabolism; it is carried by the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled out of the body. If the lungs cannot get rid of carbon dioxide, it will build up in your blood. A carbon dioxide buildup in the blood has a sedating effect on the brain, which may cause you to feel even drowsier. You may lose the motivation or energy to breathe. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In other words, if an asthma attack proceeds without proper treatment, you can get worse without realizing it. As your breathing worsens, your ability to think rationally also decreases and your brain will not recognize how ill you are becoming. This may result in you not being able to call for help. When respiratory failure develops, your condition may deteriorate rapidly. Death from respiratory arrest (cessation of breathing) can occur unexpectedly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Urgent medical attention is necessary for a first-time asthma attack. It is also appropriate when an attack continues, does not improve, or gets worse. Signs that asthma is worsening include the need to use higher doses of inhalants, frequent episodes of shortness of breath (more than two to three times per week), or decreasing peak flow measurements when using a special monitor device (which you can get from your doctor). 
            </p>

            <p>
                If you suffer from asthma, you need to have an emergency medical plan. For example, you need to know where to go for emergency medical care, and you need a contingency plan for how you can keep your emergency medicines available to you at all times (no matter where you are). Note: Adult-onset asthma (especially in obese persons) may be caused by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.

            Wheezing means you potentially have a serious lung problem.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Wheezing is the noise produced by air as it is forced through narrowed air passages in the lungs when you breathe out. Narrowing of the air passages may suddenly occur due to a squeezing of the muscles (bronchospasm) in the wall of the small airways. This produces asthma, which may be the result of an inflammatory or allergic reaction, an inhaled irritant, or a reaction to medicines, infection, stress, and/or inhaling cold air. (See Tips 169 to 171 on allergies.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Asthma attacks can be severe and life-threatening. Even if your wheezing is only mild, you could someday have an attack so severe that you would not be able to breathe. Therefore, if you wheeze, you should be evaluated for asthma. The treatment includes sprays and pills that can relax the muscles in the walls of the airways. (See Tips 57, 211, and 212 on asthma.) 
            </p>

            <p>
                Emphysema can also cause wheezing by destroying lung tissue, which results in narrowed air passages in the lungs. In emphysema there are also pockets of dead air space in the lungs, due to the disease’s destruction of the lungs’ tiny air sacs, called alveoli. This stale air takes up space in the lungs, limiting the amount of fresh air you can breathe in, and ultimately prevents you from getting enough oxygen in your blood. If the disease progresses, it can be fatal (see Tip 66 for more information on emphysema).
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, tumors in the lung and heart failure are both conditions that can block air passages and cause wheezing.

            Deformities of the chest can impair breathing. They may worsen over time, so it’s important that they are treated early.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Deformities of the chest are common birth defects that can affect the ability of the lungs to expand adequately. The chest wall is distorted, chest volume is reduced, and the heart may be displaced, encroaching on the lungs. There are three kinds of chest deformities that can interfere with breathing. Pectus excavatum is a sunken breastbone, scoliosis is a curved spine, and kyphoscoliosis is a hunchback condition with a curved spine. Of these, kyphoscoliosis is the common chest deformity that causes the most breathing problems.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have one of these conditions, then recurrent vertebral fractures, arthritis of the joints where the ribs connect to the sternum, and obesity would all pose special challenges for you. By further limiting the ability of your chest wall to expand, these factors would cause you to have more serious breathing difficulties. As you get older, the muscles of your thorax may become weaker and impair your ability to breathe. Indeed, with time, even a mild curvature of the spine may get worse and result in significant distortion of the chest. And an additional risk posed by all of these ailments is that they decrease the ability to cough up accumulated secretions and limit oxygen intake, thus increasing your chances for developing pneumonia.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a chest deformity, have your lung function checked periodically by a physician. If you develop congestion, have it checked and treated right away. Note: It is very dangerous to create more problems for your lungs by smoking.

            Excessive snoring, short episodes of “no breathing” during sleep, and/or daytime sleepiness may indicate that your oxygen supply is being cut off at night. This can result in serious health problems.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you suffer from unexplained excessive daytime sleepiness (falling asleep at stoplights or while watching television) and are told that you snore loudly or intermittently stop breathing when you sleep, then you may have a medical condition known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is more often seen in African Americans and obese adults with short, thick necks, small chins, and floppy airways. During sleep, part of the soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, or the base of the tongue is flip-flopping over your airway, causing you to snore and intermittently stop breathing for a few seconds. You may wake up without knowing why. The impact of intermittently cutting off the oxygen supply to the body has serious consequences—high blood pressure and permanent damage to the brain, heart, and lungs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The diagnosis of OSA can be made by special tests ordered by your physician. Treatment often includes the use of a breathing assist device, called a C-PAP, while sleeping. The C-PAP pushes air through a mask you wear to keep your airway open. In some selected cases surgery or special oral appliances may also be indicated to correct the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many simple things you can do to help ease your condition and minimize its negative side effects. Go on a diet if you are overweight. Since alcoholic beverages and sedative medications can worsen your condition, avoid them. Taking medications to treat insomnia when you have obstructive sleep apnea can actually be life-threatening. And, since OSA puts you in danger of falling asleep behind the wheel, don’t drive until the problem is corrected.
            </p>

            <p>
                This condition is an emergency if you stop breathing more than once every two minutes or you stop breathing for more than one minute at a time. The sooner you are evaluated and treated, the less the risk of serious complications.

                Your lungs are like a tree whose trunk and branches are tubes filled with air (see Figure 4). At the end of each branch are many tiny “balloons.” When you inhale, the air travels from the trunk of the tree through the various branches and fills these balloons (the medical term is “alveoli”) with oxygen. When you exhale, the balloons deflate, and carbon dioxide passes through the branches, to and then through the trunk and out of your mouth and nose. Very small blood vessels, called capillaries, run near these tiny balloons. At the site where the capillaries and balloons touch one another, the red blood cells flowing through the capillaries load up with oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.
            </p>

            <p>
                The various causes of shortness of breath require completely different therapies. Many causes are either a result of swelling or blockage of the tubes carrying air to and from the lungs, or a result of a problem at the site where the alveoli and blood vessels exchange gases. Shortness of breath can also be the result of weakened breathing muscles or nerves. In many instances the doctor’s first step is to give you oxygen through a mask. The second step is to treat the underlying ailment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many problems occur at the site of the tubes. Food can get stuck there, requiring the instant emergency measure of abdominal thrusts known as the Heimlich maneuver (see the section on choking in Appendix A, page 343). Alternatively, the tubes can swell from causes such as allergies, dust, and infections. While bronchitis (infection in the tubes) is treated with antibiotics, asthma (swelling of the tubes often caused by allergies) is treated with various medications to decrease the swelling and open the tubes.  
            </p>

            <p>
                If the disease is at the site of the alveoli and blood vessels, other therapies may be necessary. Blood clots in the vessels require a blood thinner, whereas a shortage of red blood cells, which carry the oxygen, may mean that you need a blood transfusion. A weak heart (heart failure) may cause a backup of fluid into the lungs, which requires medication to strengthen the pumping action of the heart or to rid the body of excess fluids (a diuretic). Also, a partial or total blockage of the heart’s arteries (angina or a heart attack) can cause shortness of breath on exertion without any accompanying chest pain (see Tips 74 and 76). In this case, certain medications can be used to increase blood flow to the heart muscle, though other interventions may also be necessary to open clogged vessels. Pneumonia causes an accumulation of bacteria or viruses, white blood cells, and other by-products of infection, which clog up the vessels and alveoli. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections. While viral pneumonias often resolve on their own, various supportive therapies such as oxygen or intravenous fluids may be needed. (See Tips 63, 65, 70, 72, and 248 for more on pneumonia.)
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are merely breathing too rapidly and your tubes, alveoli, and vessels are in good working order, you may be hyperventilating, a condition that is often brought on by some sort of distress. When you hyperventilate, you exhale too much carbon dioxide. This makes you light-headed, and even more distressed, which causes you to feel that you have to breathe even more, thus worsening your condition. Hyperventilating is associated with headache, light-headedness, blurry vision, and muscle spasms, as well as numbness and/or tingling around the mouth and hands. Many things, including frightening situations, mouth breathing, fatigue, and repeated sighs can trigger hyperventilation. Frequent sighing and yawning may be a sign of long-term hyperventilation related to underlying anxiety.
            </p>

            <p>
                The doctor can determine the cause of your shortness of breath by performing different procedures and tests, including listening to your lungs, checking the oxygen and red blood cell count in your blood, and taking various pictures of your lungs (X-rays, scans, etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
                Since shortness of breath might be a symptom of a serious heart or lung disease, and the lack of enough oxygen can cause all the parts of your body to fail, immediate medical evaluation is appropriate.

                A blow to your leg can damage the wall of a vein and cause the blood in that vein to clot. The swelling from the injury can also cause this problem, because it may slow blood flow in the vein such that clots form. Pieces of the clot can flow up the bloodstream to the lung.

            If you develop a cough and/or shortness of breath after surgery—even a week or two afterward—you may have a blood clot in your lung, or pneumonia. You are particularly at risk if you first noticed swelling and tenderness in the back of your lower leg or in your groin, where a clot could have originated before traveling in the veins to your lung.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                During and after surgery, especially if your surgery was in the belly or pelvic area or on the bones and joints, you are at a high risk of developing blood clots in the veins of your pelvis and legs because the blood flow will slow down in these areas. If a fragment of the clot breaks off and flows up the bloodstream to the lungs, you may experience sudden shortness of breath, chest pain on taking a deep breath, and a cough. (See Tips 64, 81, 175, and 249.)
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to notify your doctor immediately if you notice swelling and tenderness in your groin or leg at any time, including after surgery, even a week or two after you have gone home. Also, keep in mind that after surgery you are more susceptible to developing infections, such as pneumonia. (See Tip 248.) Pneumonia can also cause shortness of breath, coughing, and a fever.

                A blood clot in the lung occurs when a clot in a vein, often in one of the legs, breaks apart and a piece of it travels through the blood vessels into the lung. The clot may also originate in the right chamber of the heart. If the clot is small, a small area of the lung will be damaged. However, you should be aware that if you have had one blood clot, you are at a higher risk of getting another. The next one may be large; it could damage a more expansive area or even be fatal. The formation of a clot may take as much time as several days or as little time as a few hours. When the break-off occurs, however, it takes only seconds for the piece to travel to your lung.
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyone who has had surgery, prolonged bed rest, or has been sitting for a long period of time (such as while traveling by car or airplane) is more prone to getting a blood clot in a leg, often with tenderness and swelling in the back of the lower leg. Clots often also develop in the veins inside the pelvic area, with tenderness and swelling in the groin. This problem may not be noticeable until after the hospitalized patient is home. Shortness of breath could be the first sign that something is wrong.
            </p>

            <p>
                An injury to the leg can also be the cause of clotting in a leg vein, such that a clot from the injury site may travel to the lung. Please note: It is more usual for injuries to the leg to cause blood to flow out of the injured blood vessels into the tissue and then form large bruises or pockets of blood called hematomas. These pose little threat, since blood that clots outside of the blood vessels goes nowhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Certain diseases can cause blood to clot more readily. Birth control pills and/or smoking may also increase blood clotting and, if possible, should be avoided if you have a prior history of blood clots. Women on oral contraceptives who smoke are especially at risk of developing blood clots in their lungs. Pregnancy also increases your chances of developing a blood clot. Whatever the cause, blood clots are life-threatening and require emergency therapy. (Also see Tips 175 and 249.)

                Tobacco smoke irritates the entire respiratory system, including the nose, sinuses, throat, windpipe, and lungs. This irritation injures the surface of these areas, reducing their ability to remove mucous secretions and defend themselves against germ invasion. These changes lead to more frequent infections of the nose, sinuses, throat, and lungs. Damage to the mucous lining causes persistent congestion and coughing, which is a prime setup for developing pneumonia. A chronic cough may hide a lung infection or other serious lung ailment.

Emphysema, which is most often caused by smoking, can lead to permanent lung failure and eventually death. Discovering that you have emphysema should be a stimulus to stop smoking.

            <p>
                Emphysema traps air inside of the microscopic air sacs that make up the lungs. When air enters these air sacs, it has trouble getting out, due to the spasm and destruction of the walls of the tiny air passages that lead to the air sacs, and the secretions in the air passages prompted by irritation from smoke. As a result, the tiny air sacs become overinflated, and they no longer empty all of their contents when air is exhaled. This means that there is a considerable amount of dead air (air poor in oxygen) in the lungs, which leaves less room for fresh air. Also, since these sacs are where the body normally obtains its oxygen for the blood, a reduction of available oxygen in the air sacs reduces the body’s total supply of oxygen.

            <p>
                At first, you may not notice that your breathing is becoming impaired. Long before abnormalities appear on a chest X-ray or you have difficulty breathing, changes can be detected with lung-function testing. Lung-function testing involves breathing into a machine that makes several measurements, including the total lung volume as well as the rate of air flow into and out of the lungs. The primary measurement for diagnosing the severity of the emphysema is the amount of air exhaled from the lung during the first second. If you smoke, ask your doctor about a lung-function test. Pay attention to the results.

            Shortness of breath when you lie flat in bed, which wakes you up in the middle of the night and improves when you sit up, is often a sign of heart failure.

                The heart is one big muscle that pumps blood through your body. If the pump begins to fail, fluid can back up into your lungs and cause shortness of breath. Some people describe the feeling of shortness of breath as a feeling of drowning. In the early stages of heart failure, excessive shortness of breath comes only when you exercise, climb stairs, walk uphill, and/or are lying flat in bed or sleeping on one pillow. This is related to a shift in your body’s fluids. When you are erect or sitting, fluid accumulates in the dependent parts of your body—your lower legs and your feet. People with heart failure who have excess fluid will often experience swelling of their legs, ankles, and feet during the day when they are in an upright position. This may go unnoticed because it produces no discomfort. But when you are lying flat, the fluid from your legs is returned into circulation and to the heart, which is too weak to pump it all, causing the fluid to shift to the lungs.
            </p>

            <p>
                The scientific name for this condition is PND (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), which means intermittent shortness of breath at night. You go to sleep, wake up short of breath, sit up, and breathe better, only to lie back down and get short of breath again. You may eventually need to sleep on two or three pillows. If the condition gets bad enough, you may have to sit up in a chair all night.

            If you experience more shortness of breath than normal during and/or after mild exertion, particularly if you also have a rapid pulse, you may have a serious medical problem, usually in your lungs or heart.

                Normally you get short of breath and your heart speeds up when you exert yourself, such as when you run up a flight of stairs. But if your shortness of breath and/or rapid pulse continue too long after rest (usually three minutes or more), or if they occur with very mild exertion, then you may have a heart-lung problem, a low blood count, or another serious illness. Seek immediate medical evaluation and therapy.
