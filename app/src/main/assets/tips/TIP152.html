            Turning blue often indicates that you are getting an insufficient oxygen supply. This is commonly seen in children with inherited heart abnormalities and people with lung disease, but it can also occur as a side effect of certain medicines and from other causes. If your skin turns blue, you need immediate medical evaluation and possibly treatment.

                Most people think that when the skin turns blue, it is from an inability to breathe. It is true that cutting off your oxygen supply will make you turn blue in a hurry. But there are also other possible reasons for this skin discoloration.

                Normally oxygen attaches to a protein called hemoglobin in your red blood cells. This occurs as blood travels through the vessels in your lungs. The oxygen is then transported throughout the body by the red blood cells for use by all of the bodyâ€™s organs. This gives a normal pink color to the skin of Caucasians and to the mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, nose, eyes, and so on) of all people. If the oxygen supply to the blood is cut off for any reason, then the hemoglobin circulates without oxygen, giving the skin a blue appearance, called cyanosis.
            </p>

                As mentioned, certain medications and other maladies can also lead to this red light warning signal. They can alter the hemoglobin in some of your red blood cells such that they are unable to carry oxygen, turning your skin a bluish color.

                If your skin and/or lips turn blue, you need to be evaluated by a doctor immediately to determine the underlying cause. Your organs may not be receiving sufficient oxygen, which can have a long-term negative effect on your health. In many cases therapeutic intervention can reverse the disorder.
