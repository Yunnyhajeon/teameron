            If you stop taking a medication suddenly, you may develop serious complications. Therefore it is best to consult your doctor before stopping or decreasing the dosage of your medication.

                Some medications cause serious problems if you suddenly stop taking them. A few important examples are high blood pressure pills, steroid-based pills, and most antidepressants:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>If you suddenly stop taking certain blood pressure pills, not only will your blood pressure rise but in certain cases it may actually rise to such a high level that you have a stroke. For example, stopping the drug clonidine (Catapres) may result in a very high “rebound” blood pressure, possibly along with other side effects. Also, if a patient suddenly stops taking beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, carvedilol), he/she may experience angina or a heart attack as their heart rate speeds up.</li>
<li>Steroid pills may actually suppress your body’s normal production of steroids. Therefore when you stop taking them, your body may react to the very low level of inter- nally produced steroids. Your doctor should decrease the dosage slowly over time in order to allow the body to start producing the normal amount of natural steroids. (See Tip 178 for additional information on symptoms after stopping steroids.</li>
<li>SSRI antidepressant medications can have severe with- drawal reactions if stopped abruptly, such as extreme anxiety and the feeling of shock waves rippling up and down the arms. Always discuss with your doctor the timing and method for stopping these medicines.</li>
</ul>
<p>
                Since many medications can have a negative impact on your body if they are suddenly stopped, always consult a doctor immediately if you feel as though you should not or cannot follow the prescribed directions for taking your medication.
