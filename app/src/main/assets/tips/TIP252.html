                        Make sure that you know if you are being given any medication that may increase your risk of falling. If additional medication is added to your treatment plan, ask again whether these additional medications might make you dizzy or lightheaded when taken in combination with your current medications. If you begin to feel unsteady, call for help before moving about. Ask whether your medications can be altered to decrease these side effects
