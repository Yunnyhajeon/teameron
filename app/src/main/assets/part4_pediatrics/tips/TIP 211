<p>If your child has recurrent wheezing, especially when he or she gets a cold, or a recurrent nighttime cough, he/she may have asthma and should be assessed and started on appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Note: In rare cases, the wheezing may be caused by a foreign object lodged in the airway which requires urgent medical evaluation. If the child cannot speak and is clearly choking, you need to attempt to get the object out. (See Appendix A for instruction).
