            Splinterlike reddish dark spots in the fingernails may be the sign of a serious infection in the heart.

                Usually dark spots in the fingernails are due to an injury. But splinter hemorrhages in the nails may be due to fragments of material breaking off from an infected heart valve and then traveling to the tiny vessels in the fingernail beds (underneath the nails). As these tiny vessels become clogged, the damaged walls begin to leak blood into the surrounding tissue, forming the splinterlike reddish dark spots. Since these hemorrhages are not painful, they may go unnoticed. It is important to take note of them though, because the other initial symptoms of an infected heart valve are often subtle, such as slight weakness, weight loss, intermittent high fevers and/or chills, tiredness, or joint pain.

                Heart valve infections usually occur in individuals who have a heart valve abnormality. Germs that gain entrance to the bloodstream are able to invade the diseased heart valve, multiply, and build a substance called vegetation. Fragments of this vegetation, which is full of germs, can break off and spread throughout the body via the blood. The speckling on your nails might be the first (and only specific) sign of this condition.

                Germs commonly gain entrance into the bloodstream from ordinary dental work and may ultimately infect heart valves that have been damaged in the past. This is why, prior to dental procedures, dentists prescribe antibiotics to patients with a history of infected heart valves (see Tip 34). Antibiotics should also be given to these patients prior to any medical procedure that uses instruments, such as an examination of the colon or bladder. Since the use of unclean needles can cause infection of normal heart valves by introducing a large number of germs into the bloodstream, this condition is also often seen among intravenous drug abusers.

                Get immediate evaluation if you have this findingâ€”a heart valve infection (bacterial endocarditis) is a serious medical condition with a high mortality rate. It should be treated on an emergency basis in order to kill the germs before they cause serious damage to the heart.
