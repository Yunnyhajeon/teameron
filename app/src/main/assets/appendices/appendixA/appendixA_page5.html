                            <li><b>Small items:</b> Avoid giving a child any item that can fit entirely into his or her mouth or with small (under two inches) parts. This includes coins, small balls, marbles, beads, medicine syringes, and toy food. If it can fit through the opening of a toilet paper roll, it is too small for a young child.</li>
                            <li><b>Small batteries:</b> These are especially dangerous, as sometimes the acid can seriously damage the stomach lining.
