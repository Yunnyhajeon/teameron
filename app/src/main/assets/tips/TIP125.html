            Black tarry stools may indicate a hemorrhage from an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum. It is important to stop the bleeding and to rule out cancer as a cause.

<p>
                When an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) erodes into a blood vessel, hemorrhaging will occur. If the vessel is small, the blood loss may only be a trickle, but if the vessel is large, the bleeding will be brisk and life-threatening.
            </p>
<p>
                Bleeding a little from small vessels in the stomach or duodenum may go unnoticed. The blood can be spread out through the twenty feet of small bowel and the five to six feet of large bowel (the colon). This bleeding can be detected by conducting a fecal occult blood test, wherein a small amount of stool is placed on a special test card, which will change color if blood is present.
            </p>

                Blood originating from the stomach or duodenum often turns pitch black from chemicals (enzymes) in the small bowel. The stools can also take on a tarry consistency, especially if the bleeding is rapid. Belly pain caused by an ulcer may lessen when bleeding occurs because blood at the ulcer site coats the sore and protects it from the acid of the stomach. Nausea and vomiting are often not present unless there is a rapid flow of blood in the stomach.

                There are other important warning signals of blood loss. You may become very weak from a low blood count (anemia) and, if the volume of blood loss is severe, standing up may make you feel weak and light-headed. Also, your blood pressure will drop and your pulse will rise. Under these circumstances death can occur rapidly unless emergency treatment is instituted.
            </p>
<p>
                If you have vomited blood, even if it only happened once and you otherwise feel fine, do not be complacent. Keep track of your pulse; if it is rapid (around 100 beats per minute), you must take immediate action. The pulse is the most sensitive measure of rapid blood loss, and if it is above 90, or higher than your normal pulse, emergency medical assistance is needed.
            </p>
<p>
                The safest approach is to always seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment when you first note that you are passing black tarry stools.
            </p>

                Note: You may get black, but not tarry stools from taking iron supplements or Pepto-Bismol, but the stools should return to their normal color within a day if you stop taking either product.
