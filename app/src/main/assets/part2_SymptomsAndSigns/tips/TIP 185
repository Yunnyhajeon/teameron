            Your thyroid gland does not have to be enlarged in order to be overactive or underactive. The vari- ety of symptoms accompanying an overactive or underactive thyroid gland require early diagnosis and treatment to prevent serious complications.
            The red light warning signals of an overactive thyroid are: intolerance to heat, a rapid and irregular pulse, tremors, fatigue, profuse sweating, in- creased appetite, a feeling of anxiety, and/or bulging eyes.
            The red light warning signals of an underac- tive thyroid are: cold intolerance, feeling cold all of the time, loss of memory, generalized body swelling (especially of the face), irregular and slow pulse, and/or a high cholesterol level.
