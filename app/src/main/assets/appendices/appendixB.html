            <p>
                Many doctors recommend that you perform a selfexamination on your breasts in the same way at least once a month. The best time to perform a breast self-exam is about seven to ten days after your period, when your breasts are not swollen and tender. After menopause, check your breasts on the first day of every month. Regular self-examinations will familiarize you with what your breasts feel like normally so that you will be able to detect any changes. <b>However, it is important to remember that this should not take the place of a mammogram, which can pick up curable breast masses you can’t feel.</b> Ask your doctor to review your self-exam technique when you go in for a routine health exam. The early detection and treatment of cancer increases the chance of a cure.

                The following are the current guidelines for examining your breasts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Lie down flat on your back with a pillow under your right shoulder.</li>
                    <li>Place your right arm behind your head (see Figure 18).</li>
                    <li>Press the pads of the three middle fingers of your left hand firmly on your right breast. (A ridge in the lower curve of each breast is normal.)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move your fingers around all parts of the breast, using a sequence of three different motions. Make sure you check the entire breast area between your ribs and your collarbone  (clavicle):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First, use an overlapping, dime-size, circular motion.</li>
                        <li>Second, use an in-and-out motion with three different levels of pressure—light, medium, and firm—so that you can feel the tissue closest to the skin, the tissue that’s a little deeper, and the tissue closest to the chest and ribs. Use each level of pressure before moving your hand to the next spot. You may want to talk to your doctor or nurse about how hard to press.</li>
                        <li>Third, a vertical up-and-down pattern, starting at the underarm and moving across the breast to the middle of your torso or sternum (breastbone).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
	            <ul>
	                <li>Examine your breasts while taking a shower. Soapy hands over wet skin make it easy to check for lumps. Use a similar technique to the one noted earlier.</li>
	                <li>Put the pillow under your left shoulder, and repeat the above steps, this time with your left breast.</li>
	                <li>Stand in front of a mirror with your hands pressed firmly on your hips, and note any changes in the way your breasts look, such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple, changes in the texture of the skin (so that it resembles an orange peel), redness, or swelling (see Figure 19).</li>
	            </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                <ul><li>Examine each underarm from a sitting or standing position with your arm slightly raised so the underarm skin is not stretched tight.</li></ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If you find any changes, see your doctor as soon as possible.

        	<h3>Testicular Exam</h3>
    	</div>

    		<p>
               Many doctors recommend examining your testicles at least once a month beginning at puberty (see Figure 20). Performing regular testicular exams will help you become familiar with what is normal, and may help you detect a mass early. This should be in addition to, not as a replacement for, the testicular exam performed by your doctor as part of your routine cancer-related checkup (especially between the ages of fourteen to thirty-five). The doctor may discover an abnormality you might miss. Early detection and treatment of cancer may lead to a cure.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following are the current guidelines for examining your testicles:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>During or after a warm bath or shower is the best time to perform the self-exam.</li>
                    <li>Separately examine each testicle, holding the penis out of the way.</li>
                    <li>Holding the testicle between your thumb and two fingers, roll it gently between your fingers. A normal testicle is smooth and round and feels like a hard-boiled egg. Each should move freely in your scrotal sac.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
