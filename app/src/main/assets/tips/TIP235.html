            Babies and young children can easily swallow a harmful medicine or a dangerous household item like bleach, batteries, etc. If your child does not talk yet, look for signs that they have been poisoned with a toxic substance. If you are in doubt, call your regional poison control center or the American Association of Poison Control Centers (1-800-222-1222) for advice.

                If your child has swallowed a potentially dangerous substance, it may be obvious—he or she may tell you, or you may see him/her with the container. But your child could have swallowed a toxic substance unobserved. The following are some of the symptoms resulting from poisoning:
                <ul>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Severe throat pain</li>
<li>Burns on the lips or mouth</li>
<li>Convulsions</li>
<li>Unconsciousness</li>
<li>Sudden unusual behavior, dizziness, weakness, or illnes</li>
<li>Abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting</li>
<li>Blurred vision, a change in pupil size</li>
<li>Loss of bowel or bladder control</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                If you suspect that your child has swallowed a toxic substance, do the following:
                <ul>
<li>Stabilize your child. Check his or her breathing, and then resuscitate him/her if necessary (see Appendix A, page 350, for information about CPR). Place him/her in the recovery position (lying on the side with the mouth aimed toward the ground so that if your child vomits he or she will not choke). If the child is ill or not fully awake, call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
<li>Identify the substance and the amount that was swallowed. Search carefully for any suspect containers, and bring anything you find with you to the ER. If the swallowed substance was vitamin tablets with iron, for example, try to estimate the number missing from the container. If there are toxic chemicals on your child’s skin or eyes, remove the contaminated clothes and place them in a plastic bag so that you can bring them with you to the ER without further contaminating anyone. Wash the child thoroughly with plain water and get him or her to an emergency room right away.</li>
<li>If your child is stable, or even has no symptoms, but you know that he or she has ingested a potentially poisonous substance, you should still call your local poison control center (the number should be listed in your phone directory under emergency numbers) or the American Association of Poison Control Centers at 1-800-222-1222.</li>
<li>Do not induce vomiting. Induction of vomiting is no longer suggested in the management of accidental poisoning, because it can cause complications in the esophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach) or lungs.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                If you happen to witness your child swallowing a potentially harmful substance, do not wait for him or her to become ill. Seek advice immediately. Delay can be fatal! Remember, the best way to save your child’s life from poisoning is to not let him or her get near any toxic compounds. Store all your medicines and dangerous household items in a safe place.
