                register an oral temperature. With a glass thermometer, it takes two to three minutes to register.</p>

<p><b>A Summary of the Accuracy Issue</b></p>
<p>
A temperature properly taken either orally or rectally is considered to be the most accurate. When taking an oral temperature, the child must keep his/her mouth closed and the thermometer under his/her tongue. Most children cannot do this until they are at least four years of age. Accuracy is very important in identifying an elevated temperature in children under two years of age, and especially in children under six months old. Elevations in temperature can be missed with less accurate axillary (under the arm) measurements. Missing an elevated temperature can have life-threatening consequences in a young child, particularly in an infant.
</p>
<p>
An axillary temperature is generally considered to be lower than the actual core temperature. There is no consensus about the accuracy of other methods, such as the use of the ear or forehead thermometer. Some doctors suggest the use of the ear thermometer as an alternative to taking a rectal or axillary temperature, while others feel it is often inaccurate—the readings can vary greatly depending on the angle at which the thermometer is held within the ear, variations in ear anatomy, and the temperature of the child’s environment (i.e., the ear, itself, may be cold). Some doctors suggest that the forehead (temporal artery) thermometer is a good alternative to taking a rectal or axillary temperature, but others question the accuracy since, in certain circumstances, the forehead may be cooler than the core body temperature. When in doubt—for example, if any of these alternative methods do not register an elevated temperature and you still believe the child has a fever—it may be wise to take a rectal temperature.
