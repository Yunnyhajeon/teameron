            The red light warning signals that you may have a rapid or irregular heartbeat are: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped or pounding beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, a feeling like “squirrels running around in the chest,” and a feeling like your heart is beating at the base of your throat. If you think your heartbeat is abnormally fast, slow, or irregular, take your pulse. An abnormal pulse can be a warning sign of many different life-threatening illnesses.
