            Courses on how to respond to the following emergencies are available through the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, or local hospitals. It is advisable to take these courses for in-depth training so that you can be better prepared for emergency situations.

            <h3>Choking</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Choking often happens because something is obstructing the airway. The choking person may have a sudden onset of coughing and redness, or he or she may suddenly turn blue in color and be unable to cough or speak.

            <p><b>Partial Airway Obstruction</b></p>
            If the choking person is still able to cough and/or speak, stay with them and encourage them to continue coughing. Pay close attention and be prepared to act when needed.

            <p><b>Full Airway Obstruction</b></p>
            If the choking person is unable to cough or speak, you need to act rapidly before they become limp and pale.

            <p><b>How to Help If the Person Is Above the Age of One and Consciousâ€”Abdominal Thrusts, i.e., the Heimlich Maneuver</b></p>
                <ul>
        <li><b>Position:</b> Kneel or stand behind the child or adult with your arms joined firmly against his or her upper abdomen in the center, between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage (see Figure 17). If the person is alert and conscious, explain gently what you are about to do.</li>
        <li><b>Action:</b> Give up to five rapid, firm, upward thrusts until the object dislodges and the individual begins to breathe. Try to avoid pulling on the ribs.</li>
        <li><b>If no success:</b> If the victim is still conscious, repeat the maneuver. If he or she becomes unconscious, begin CPR. (See the following guidelines for CPR.)</li>
                </ul>
