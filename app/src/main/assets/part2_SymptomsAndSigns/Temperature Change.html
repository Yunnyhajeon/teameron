            Prolonged exposure to cold can cause fatal body hypothermia.

                The body’s protective mechanisms maintain its temperature at around 98.6 degrees, which is necessary for carrying out normal body functions. Internal control mechanisms help maintain body temperature by routing blood away from the surface of the body (the area just beneath the skin) and the extremities (the arms and legs), and by shivering to generate heat. If the body still cannot contain warmth, the body temperature drops and symptoms begin to appear. They are:
            </p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Confusion and forgetfulness</li>
                    <li>Sluggishness and fatigue</li>
                    <li>Lack of coordination</li>
                    <li>Slurred speech</li>
                    <li>Shivering (when shivering stops, the condition is getting worse)</li>
                    <li>Heart palpitations (heartbeat is irregular, slow, or fast)</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                If the body’s temperature continues to drop, it can lead to coma and death. Older adults are at the highest risk of becoming ill from their body temperature dropping.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you encounter someone who is hypothermic:
            </p>    
                 <ul>
                    <li>Get the person to a warm room. Do not immerse them in a tub of hot water or place them in front of a heater or fireplace. The sudden exposure to excessive heat may worsen their condition.</li>
                    <li>Remove any wet clothing.</li>
                    <li>Cover the person with blankets.</li>
                    <li>Warm the person with close body contact, but do not rub their skin.</li>
                    <li>Offer the person warm fluids if they can drink. Do not give them an alcoholic beverage.)</li>
                    <li>Seek emergency medical assistance.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Note: A hypothermic person can sometimes be revived even after prolonged cardiac arrest; it is thought that the low body temperature can prevent cell damage for an extended period of time.

            Fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache are the first symptoms of heat exhaustion and they may progress to a life-threatening case of heatstroke if you do not respond appropriately. Working or playing in the hot sun can be dangerous, as can a lack of proper ventilation and air-conditioning in the summertime (particularly for the elderly). Anyone who appears to act confused after being in a hot environment needs to be cooled down and taken to the ER immediately.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                It is hard to tell when you are in danger of heat exhaustion. When you are active on a hot day, the body uses its cooling mechanism to release sweat, because the evaporation of sweat on the body’s surface allows it to shed heat. The body is generally able to keep an even temperature this way, but environmental factors like high humidity and the absence of a breeze can make it difficult for the body to cool itself. Also, individuals with fewer sweat glands are in greater danger of heat exhaustion, as are senior citizens and young children, who have less effective cooling mechanisms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fluid loss and a rise in body temperature can result in a serious derangement of body chemistry. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include any combination of the following:
            </p>
               
                <ul>
                    <li>Nausea</li>
                    <li>Dizziness and/or headache</li>
                    <li>Weakness, fatigue</li>
                    <li>Paleness</li>
                    <li>Incoordination and/or confusion</li>
                    <li>Muscle cramps</li>
                    <li>Vomiting</li>
                    <li>Low or no urine output</li>
                    <li>Pounding heartbeat</li>
                    <li>Fainting</li>
                </ul>
            

            <p>
                If you have any of the above symptoms, it is urgent that you do the following in order to avoid heatstroke:
             </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Rest.</li>
                    <li>Move to the shade or indoors with air-conditioning. Sit in front of a fan.</li>
                    <li>Place a wet towel over your face, arms, and legs.</li>
                    <li>Spray yourself with cool water.</li>
                    <li>Drink cool, nonalcoholic beverages, such as apple juice or Gatorade, to replace your electrolytes. Note: Eating a banana may help replace potassium in the body if you don’t have access to Gatorade.</li>
                    <li>Seek medical assistance, especially if your symptoms include a feeling of confusion. Call 911 or get somebody to take you to the ER immediately. You may need to be given intravenous fluids or other therapy in order to cool down quickly.</li>
                </ul>
           

            <p>
                The most effective method of handling heat exhaustion is to prevent it. Take frequent breaks from exercise and exposure to heat. If you get tired, rest and cool off for a while.

            Your thyroid gland does not have to be enlarged in order to be overactive or underactive. The vari- ety of symptoms accompanying an overactive or underactive thyroid gland require early diagnosis and treatment to prevent serious complications.
            The red light warning signals of an overactive thyroid are: intolerance to heat, a rapid and irregular pulse, tremors, fatigue, profuse sweating, in- creased appetite, a feeling of anxiety, and/or bulging eyes.
            The red light warning signals of an underac- tive thyroid are: cold intolerance, feeling cold all of the time, loss of memory, generalized body swelling (especially of the face), irregular and slow pulse, and/or a high cholesterol level.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>   
                The thyroid gland is located in the center of the base of the neck (see Figure 14). It serves as the body’s thermostat, regulating the metabolic functions—that is to say, how quickly or slowly you burn up calories. An overactive thyroid promotes a rapid metabolic rate, while an underactive one slows it down.
            </p>

            <p>
                The size of your thyroid gland has nothing to do with whether it is overactive or underactive. If the gland has not changed in size but is functioning abnormally, you may not know to seek treatment since the symptoms may have developed gradually.
            </p>

            <p>
                An overactive thyroid gland, producing excess thyroid hormone, causes the symptoms listed above, and may even cause heart failure.
            </p>

            <p>
                An underactive thyroid produces an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. Besides the general symptoms listed above, you may experience marked weakness, confusion, and/or paleness or a yellowish appearance.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both conditions are frequently associated with fatigue and double vision. An overactive thyroid can cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities, while an underactive thyroid can result in a high cholesterol level. These and many other complications are a good reason to seek medical care as soon as possible when the symptoms creep up on you.
