            The bite of an animal with rabies can be fatal. Therefore, if you are bitten by a dog, cat, raccoon, fox, skunk, horse, bat, or any other warm-blooded animal, you need immediate medical attention. Note: You can also get rabies from exposure to the saliva of a rabid animal (via contact with an open wound or your mucous membranes). For example, bats flying in the room of a sleeping person or near an awake, unattended child have been reported to have spread the disease to the individual, even when there has been no evidence of a bite.      
        </div>

            <p>
                Animals with rabies, including dogs, cats, horses, skunks, bats, foxes, and raccoons, can transmit their disease to you through a bite. The virus can also be transferred if the animal’s saliva comes in contact with an open cut on your body or with your mucous membranes—for example, your eyes or mouth. If you get the appropriate immunoglobulin and vaccination shots after contact with a rabid animal, you can avoid developing the disease.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately the time between your exposure to the disease and the appearance of symptoms is normally within two to twelve weeks (though this can happen over a shorter or much longer period of time). If you are bitten by a pet that appears healthy, observe the animal for ten days and begin to get postexposure rabies treatment only if it begins to act strangely. If the pet is rabid or suspected rabid, you will need immediate treatment, which involves receiving a series of shots. If you are bitten by a wild animal, such as a bat, raccoon, skunk, fox, or most other carnivores, the animal should be regarded as rabid unless it can be captured and proven negative with laboratory testing. If the animal is not captured, immediate vaccination should be considered. This is crucial, since untreated rabies is almost one hundred percent fatal.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are going to be traveling to developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially if you plan to spend time hiking, consult with your health-care provider about getting a pre-exposure vaccination against rabies. In these countries, dog rabies may be more common and  preventive treatment can be difficult to obtain. Keep in mind that pre-exposure vaccination does not offer full protection; however, it reduces the amount of post-exposure therapy needed and allows you to go a longer time before getting it.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Of course, whenever you get bitten by an animal, follow standard first-aid protocol; wash the area immediately with soap and water, apply antibiotic ointment, etc.

            If you have had a severe allergic reaction, the next time it could be worse—even life-threatening. Swelling of the lips and throat and difficulty breathing after a bee sting or exposure to another allergen  are  red  light  warning  signals.  Skip directly to Tip 169 if you are currently experiencing these symptoms.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Serious allergic reactions can get worse with every episode. Vital areas of the body can become more sensitized, resulting in increasingly severe reactions with each exposure. Such sensitization can lead to massive swelling, with closure of the windpipe, shock, and death.
            </p>

            <p>
                If there is any possibility that you might be at risk of a severe allergic reaction to any biting or stinging insect, food, cosmetic, plant, dye, and so on, carry an emergency treatment kit with you at all times (see Tip 169). An immediate shot of adrenaline after a life-threatening reaction—with sudden shortness of breath, wheezing, and weakness—could save your life. Some treatments can reduce the severity of these allergic reactions. Consult your doctor or an allergist.

            Human bites are serious. The bitten area can become infected, requiring treatment by a physician.

                Believe it or not, there are more germs in a human mouth than that of a dog. If someone’s teeth go through your skin, even if it is a shallow cut on your hand from punching their mouth, watch out. The wound may look fine for the first forty-eight hours, only to develop redness and swelling later on, followed by pus. Immediate antiseptic cleansing and the removal of the damaged tissue from the wound as soon as possible by a health professional can often prevent the spread of infection. Also, get a tetanus shot if you have not had one in the past ten years.

            Antivenom shots may save your life if you are bitten by a poisonous snake. The area of the bite is often swollen and painful.
        </div>

                If the snake’s poison gets into your bloodstream, death may be sudden unless you can get immediate treatment. Examination of the snake (dead or alive) can determine if it is poisonous, helping the doctor decide what treatment is necessary. Do not attempt to capture or kill the snake if it puts you in danger of another bite, but, if safe to do so, bring the snake or its remnants to the doctor’s office. At the very least, try to get an accurate description of the snake.

                The following steps should be taken at the time you are bitten, if they will not cause excessive delay in getting you medical care:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stay calm.</li>
                    <li>Try to immobilize the area that has been bitten.</li>
                    <li>Wipe the wound with a clean cloth to remove poison left on the skin.</li>
                    <li>Do not apply a tourniquet, cut open the bite, or suction or tamper with the wound in any way.</li>
                    <li>Seek emergency medical care.</li>

            The bite of a tick can cause staggering, a lack of coordination, or even paralysis. These symptoms usually clear when the tick is removed.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A tick bite on the back of the neck near the base of the skull can cause “tick paralysis.” The tick attaches, burrows its head through the skin, feeds on your blood, and regurgitates a toxin into your skin.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you stagger and become uncoordinated for no apparent reason, examine the back of your neck and other parts of your body for a tick. Whether or not you find one, it is important to seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment if you have these symptoms. If you do find a tick, it is important to remove the entire insect. This can be done by putting alcohol on the tick to relax it, and then stretching the skin and pulling the tick off with tweezers. Doctors recommend placing the tweezers at the base of the head (where the neck would be) pulling gently, and the tick should become loose.
