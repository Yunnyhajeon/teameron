            Changes in a breast, including redness and/or swelling, dimpling of the skin, orange-peel appearance of the skin, nipple retraction, or crusty appearance of the nipple may indicate cancer even if you cannot feel a mass. A thorough medical evaluation is necessary as soon as possible.

<p>
                If you were born with retracted nipples—nipples that do not project outward—you may have more difficulty nursing babies. Otherwise, you should have no problems related to your nipples. However, retraction of a previously normal nipple may be caused by a growth located under the nipple, which could be cancerous.

                Deformities of the skin of the breast that cause redness or swelling, dimpling, an orange-peel appearance, and/or a crusty appearance of the nipples indicate a progressive disease in the breast that may be cancer. These changes can be subtle, often occurring without pain. They are red light warning signals calling for immediate medical evaluation.
