            A sudden, agonizing, “thunderclap” headache, more severe than any you have ever experienced, could mean you are bleeding in the brain. This is an emergency.

                Most headaches are caused by factors such as stress, sinus infection, seasonal allergies, dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, eye strain, lack of sleep, low blood sugar, or migraines. These types of headaches are usually self-limited and will often go away with rest and/or over-the-counter medication. But if you ever get a sudden, severe headache that you consider the worst headache of your life or that feels different from any headache you have previously experienced, you may have a hemorrhage in your brain. In many cases this occurs after physical exertion. Again, this is a medical emergency.

                A <b>subarachnoid hemorrhage</b> is the medical term for bleeding around the brain that pools in the subarachnoid space—the space between the skull and the brain. Your skull, which is like a tight-fitting helmet that protects your brain, does not allow room for the blood that accumulates during this kind of hemorrhage. This results in increased pressure on your brain. If the subarachnoid hemorrhage is significant, the blood will continue to accumulate in the skull, which causes spasms of blood vessels, increased fluid in the brain, and increased pressure within the brain. Because the brain has the consistency of Jell-O, this can result in serious damage.

                Though more commonly caused by head trauma, a subarachnoid hemorrhage may also result from an aneurysm in the brain. Aneurysms—weakened areas on the walls of arteries—may be congenital (present at birth) or may appear later in life. Their rupture is sometimes the result of cocaine or amphetamine abuse. The symptoms of a hemorrhage in the brain include severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, seizures, blackouts, sleepiness, slurred speech, double vision, unequal pupil size, and/or mental confusion. Often only the severe headache is present, which may sometimes improve briefly, only to be followed by coma.

                If you experience the worst headache of your life, or a “thunderclap” headache (one that has maximal intensity at onset), call 911 or get someone to take you to an emergency room immediately. Do not take any aspirin for pain relief— since aspirin blocks the ability of the platelets to form a clot, you may end up bleeding more. If you call 911 or go to the emergency room, you need to make sure they know you are having “the worst headache of your life.” This way they will know that you need to be seen by a doctor right away. In addition, if a friend or family member complains of a new, severe headache and then becomes sleepy or difficult to awaken, it may also be a hemorrhage in the brain and a medical emergency.

                Early diagnosis is important because if left untreated, at least one in five people dies from this condition. Medication and/or surgery (which can include stopping the bleeding, preventing the re-bleeding, and/or decreasing the pressure within the brain by draining fluid and blood from the skull) increases the chances for survival.
