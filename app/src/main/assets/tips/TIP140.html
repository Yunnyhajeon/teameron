            Pain in your legs, hips, and/or buttocks when you walk could be from arthritis but could also be from clogged arteries. When occuring in the leg, it is usually only in one. When the blockage of the arteries is total, gangrene of the leg and infection can occur. This infection may then spread to the rest of your body.

                Pain in the legs during activities such as walking that is relieved during rest is usually due to insufficient blood flow to the legs. During activity the leg muscles require more blood, and when they do not receive it, you feel pain. The distance you can walk before the pain occurs is determined by the degree of blockage in the artery to your leg. A severe blockage may bring on the pain after walking only a few feet, and a less severe blockage may allow you to walk without pain for as much as a quarter of a mile. In very rare cases, the pain occurs at the first attempt to walk but then disappears after you have been walking for a while. If the blockage is in the arteries of the thighs, then the pain will be in the calves. A higher blockage will cause pain in the hips, buttocks, and thighsâ€”this type of blockage is more commonly seen in patients who smoke, or have diabetes or high cholesterol.

                If a blood clot forms in the markedly narrowed area of the artery, then a complete blockage of the artery will follow, with severe leg pain. If the blood flow is interrupted for too long, causing gangrene, there is risk that a life-threatening infection will spread throughout the body. In this scenario, amputation of the leg may be necessary.

                If you experience pain in your leg when you walk, you should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. It is best to correct the problem before total blockage occurs. Circulation may be restored by cleaning out the blockage: The artery can be reopened at the narrowed area with a small tube tipped with an inflatable balloon. Surgical repair is also possible: One end of a small piece of blood vessel can be sewn to the blocked vessel above the site of the obstruction, while the other end is sewn below the site of the blockage. This will allow blood to bypass or detour the site of the obstruction. A third approach is to inject a substance into the blood vessel that can dissolve the blood clot.
