            disease (PID) and/or with symptoms of a cervical infection (cervicitis) found during a pelvic exam should be screened for chlamydia as well. Additionally, chlamydia screening is recommended during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy if the woman has had high-risk sexual behavior. Treatment during pregnancy can prevent passing the infection to the newborn.
</p>
<p>
Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are all becoming more common. Therefore, it is more important than ever for you to regularly get screened for all of these sexually transmitted diseases if you are a sexually active man or woman, especially if you are under the age of thirty-five.
</p>
<p>
Another reason in particular to screen for syphilis is that the symptoms may disappear on their own without treatment, allowing the disease to remain dormant in the body for many years. The reproductive organs may be seriously compromised by syphilis if it is left untreated on a long-term basis. Also, life-threatening complications may appear later in life in those not treated.

Note: Of course, all people who have high-risk sexual behaviors should also be screened for HIV/AIDS.

<p><b>Early Detection of Testicular Cancer</b></p>
A testicular exam should be part of every manâ€™s routine checkup. Often, testicular cancer can be picked up early by finding a lump. Testicular cancer is most common between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four, but can also occur later in life. Many doctors believe that self-examination of your testicles for lumps once or twice a month beginning at age fourteen may contribute to the early detection of cancer (see Appendix B for instructions on how to perform a self-exam). However, self-examination should not take the place of examination by your doctor as part of your routine physical exam. Men whose testicles did not descend naturally and were surgically placed in their scrotum as babies are at a higher risk of developing testicular cancer. They should let their doctor know so they can be closely monitored. Other risk factors for developing testicular cancer include a family history of this type of cancer or a previous germ cell tumor in one testicle.

<p><b>Early Detection of Prostate Cancer</b></p>
African-American men and also men who have first-degree relatives who have had prostate cancer should consider having a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test and digital rectal exam annually beginning at age forty. All other men should begin screening
