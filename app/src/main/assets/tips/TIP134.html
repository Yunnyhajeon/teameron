            If you are not pregnant and you have irregular menses, miss your periods, and/or have fluid leaking from engorged breasts, you may have a tumor of the pituitary gland, which is located on  the undersurface of your brain. Another sign that this may be the case is if you have limited peripheral vision.

                The following signs may indicate that you have a tumor of the pituitary gland:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>The onset of puberty before the age of nine</li>
<li>A sudden abnormal change in your usual pattern of menstruation—for example, missing periods for several months (when not pregnant)</li>
<li>A feeling of “fullness” in your breasts or a milky white discharge from your nipples (when not pregnant)</li>
<li>Limitations in your peripheral vision. You cannot see objects coming from either side when you are looking straight ahead. Your vision is like that of a horse wearing blinders (see Tip 19).</li>
</ul>
<p>
                The pituitary gland produces hormones that regulate many other glands in the body. A pituitary tumor alters production of these hormones, which often results in changes in the activity of the glands that the pituitary gland regulates, such as the ovaries, which drive the menstrual cycle, and the breasts, which produce milk. A high level of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, suggests a tumor.
            </p>
<p>
                The above symptoms are all indications that a tumor may be growing in the pituitary gland. Early medical evaluation and treatment can cure this abnormal growth.
            </p>
<p>
                Note: Shingles (a painful rash caused by a virus), sexual foreplay with the nipples, hypothyroidism (low thyroid gland function), and medications such as Thorazine and oral contraceptives can also cause nipple discharge.
