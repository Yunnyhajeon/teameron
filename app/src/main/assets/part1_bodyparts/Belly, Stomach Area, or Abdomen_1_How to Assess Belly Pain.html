                <b>Where, specifically, is your belly pain?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Many things can go wrong inside the belly cavity and cause pain. Some are serious and can endanger your life, while others may not require any treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Draw an imaginary line horizontally across the belly at the level of the belly button. Draw a second line vertically from the lower tip of the breastbone through the belly button to the pelvic bone. This effectively divides the belly into four areas or quadrants: two upper, and two lower (see Figure 10). The location of your belly pain may provide an invaluable clue as to what is wrong, as it often (though not always) points to which organ is involved (see Figure 11).
            </p>

            <p>
                The following ailments are commonly located in the upper half, the lower half, or in one of the four quadrants of the belly area (as seen from your perspective, if you were examining your own belly). Note: The less common causes of bellyaches are not mentioned here.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>1.	The upper half of the belly area:</b> Stomach or duodenal ulcers and pancreatitis pains are commonly found in this region. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>2.	The lower half of the belly area:</b> Pains from bladder or prostate infections, as well as infections and tumors in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus occur in this region.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3.	Your right lower quadrant:</b> A common and potentially serious cause of pain in this area is appendicitis. Other considerations include kidney stones, colitis, and—in women—problems with the fallopian tubes and ovaries.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>4.	Your right upper quadrant:</b>  The most common cause of pain in this area is gallstones, which may lead to infection in the gallbladder. Hepatitis (liver inflammation) may also cause pain in this area.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>5.	Your left upper quadrant:</b> This area contains part of the stomach, part of the colon, and the spleen. A common cause of pain in this area is gas in the colon, which is usually short-lived. Ulcers of the stomach can cause persistent pain in this area. Injuries (e.g., a spleen ruptured from blunt trauma to the belly) or diseases of the spleen can also cause pain here.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>6.	Your left lower quadrant:</b> Pain from diverticulitis of the large bowel and from kidney stones can occur here. In women, infections in the fallopian tubes and ovaries are also considerations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Is your belly tender when pressed upon?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Many serious causes of bellyache are accompanied by belly tenderness. It is important to test whether your belly is tender. Tenderness means that when you press down on a specific area of the belly with your fingers, the pressure makes it hurt. Most bellyaches from minor causes, such as a “stomach virus” or flu, are associated with very little belly tenderness. Though the serious causes of bellyache generally <i>do</i> involve tenderness, there are some exceptions. For example, kidney stones can be serious, but they cause a bellyache with little or no associated tenderness.
            </p>

            <p>
                When belly tenderness occurs, it is usually most severe over the organ that is involved. If the inflammation or infection of the involved organ worsens and irritates the inside lining of the belly cavity, the pattern of the tenderness will change, spreading over the entire abdomen.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Does your belly pain get worse when you release your hand from the area where it has been pressed?</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                After you press your fingers down on an area of the belly, then suddenly release them, usually no pain occurs. But if this maneuver causes pain (called rebound tenderness), it usually means that the inside lining of the belly cavity is being irritated, perhaps from a specific disease that is spreading over the entire abdomen. This suggests a worsening of the problem.

                <b>
                    Can you feel any lumps or pulsations in your belly?
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                A hard area felt in the belly may mean the presence of an abnormal growth like a tumor or an abscess (a pus pocket). If the hard area pulsates with your heartbeat, it may be an artery that is ballooning out (dilating), known as an aneurysm. This condition warrants immediate medical attention. Firmness in the belly due to a muscle spasm of the belly wall can be mistaken for a problem originating within the belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>
                    How would you describe your belly pain?
                </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                How the pain started, how it feels, and where it goes are important diagnostic considerations. It is therefore valuable for you to be able to describe these symptoms to your doctor.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                What kind of pain do you have? Is it a cramping pain similar to the pain you feel when you get diarrhea or the urgent need to have a bowel movement? This kind of pain occurs when something contracts (squeezes) or goes into a spasm. Many of the hollow organs in the belly area—intestines, stomach, and gallbladder—have unique pain receptors called pressure receptors, meaning that anything that increases the pressure on the walls of these organs beyond a certain point will cause pain. On the other hand, these organs have no receptors that can detect cutting with a sharp object. For instance, the belly may be opened up under local anesthesia, with the individual awake, without causing pain. The bowel can also be cut under these circumstances. But if the bowel is grasped and squeezed, pain will occur. This makes sense when you consider that the danger to hollow organs is blockage, which can cause overexpansion, and possibly a rupture. Many diseases increase the pressure on the walls of these hollow organs, thereby causing cramping or colicky (spasmodic) pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other kinds of bellyaches are dull, like a toothache.  This often occurs when organs are infected or swollen. A sharper pain can occur in the belly when something ruptures, such as a cyst, dumping blood or other liquid material inside the belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                How the pain starts can be a very important consideration in diagnosing the problem. Was the onset abrupt? A sudden onset suggests that something ruptured (in the case of a sharp pain) or spasmed (in the case of cramping pain). Gradual onset with increasing severity suggests that something inside is irritated, inflamed, or infected, and is getting worse as the pain and swelling increase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Where the pain extends is another important clue. Did it start in a certain area of the belly and remain there, or did it start in one area and spread to involve the entire belly? Pain that starts in one area and spreads suggests a progression of the problem.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another type of pain is a sudden, sharp pain that occurs in one of the lower areas of the belly, and then sometimes spreads to one of the shoulders as well. This can occur if something like an ovarian cyst or a tubal pregnancy has ruptured and is causing blood or pus to irritate the diaphragm (the breathing muscle separating the belly cavity from the chest). If enough blood is released and it moves along the back wall of the belly cavity up to the diaphragm, then irritation of the nerve in the diaphragm will project a pain sensation to the left shoulder. While a similar pain is projected to the left shoulder from a rupture of the spleen, the bellyache will occur in the left upper area of the belly as opposed to the lower area of the belly. This type of pain rarely happens on the right side, because the liver prevents the blood from getting under the diaphragm on the right.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pain in the belly that goes through to the back usually means something is wrong with an organ attached to the back of the belly compartment, such as the pancreas, the duodenum (first part of the small intestine), or the aorta (the large artery descending from the heart). Gallbladder pain often radiates along the back to the right shoulder blade. Keep in mind that if you have diabetes then there is damage to the nerves in your body, and you might not sense much abdominal pain.
