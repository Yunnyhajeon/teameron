            Persistent hoarseness for more than three weeks may be caused by cancer of the vocal cords or another
            serious illness. Seek medical evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat specialist as soon as possible.

                Your voice is generated by the vibrations of your vocal cords, which are located in the area of the
                throat called the larynx (a structure in the upper part of the breathing tube). Changes in the vocal
                cords can cause hoarseness. Think of a vocal cord as a guitar stringâ€”the thicker the string, the lower
                the pitch. As the cord swells, the pitch of your voice will become increasingly lower, until it becomes
                nothing more than a whisper.

                The two most common causes of hoarseness of the vocal cords are irritation from infection and swelling
                from excessive voice use. These conditions usually go away after a few days. Allergies and acid reflux
                from the stomach can also contribute to hoarseness. In the case of allergies, this can cause the
                hoarseness to come and go with the seasons.

                Persistent hoarseness (lasting for more than three weeks), however, may be a tip-off to throat cancer,
                which causes permanent thickening of a vocal cord. This occurs more commonly in smokers and probably in
                people with chronic acid reflux from the stomach. A cure is possible with early diagnosis and treatment.

                Persistent hoarseness can also result from the routine occurrence of fluid entering the lungs when the
                liquids you drink go up your nose as you swallow. This condition may be indicative of a nerve or muscle
                disorder, a stroke, or a tumor.
