            Anytime your body temperature exceeds 99.8 de- grees Fahrenheit, you have a fever and something is causing it.

                Having a fever does not mean feeling hot. It means an actual elevation of your body temperature, which is usually between 98.6 to 99.4 degrees. Normally your temperature is higher in the evening, though it still should not be over 99.4. (It begins to decrease again during your nighttime rest due to total body inactivity.) To allow for inaccuracies in taking your tempera- ture, a good arbitrary level to set as being abnormal is 100.4 degrees with an oral thermometer. Therefore anytime your temperature is above 100.4 degrees, you have a fever, and you need to know why. Note: The elderly generally run about 0.5 degrees cooler than younger adults, and they can sometimes have even a severe infection without an elevated temperature.

               Fever is an indication that your body is combating an illness caused by a virus or bacterium. But cancer and various auto- immune diseases (where the body fights against itself) can also cause fever, which may be the only clue that illness is present. You should seek medical evaluation if you have a persistently elevated temperature, even without an apparent cause. Early treatment of these illnesses often reduces the risk of serious complications. Note: A fever over 103.5 degrees often indicates a serious infection and should be evaluated immediately.

                The rise-and-fall pattern of the body’s temperature may provide a clue as to the cause of the fever, so keeping a chart monitoring temperature levels at various times may be helpful in diagnosing the problem. Also, when you have a fever, your temperature is often elevated in the evening but normal in the morning. You should never consider yourself well until your temperature has been normal for at least a twenty-four-hour period.

                An oral temperature is very accurate. However, if a person is unable, for any reason, to hold a thermometer under his or her tongue, there are other options for measuring a temperature, including under the arm, in the ear, on the forehead, and rectally (the most accurate). A comprehensive discussion of these alternatives is in Appendix D, Taking a Child’s Temperature, on page 393. (In many cases, the issues apply to both children and adults.) To convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32 and divide by 1.8. To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8 and add 32.
