        There are many medical screening tests that can detect risks of illnesses or actual illnesses early, thus providing the possibility of preventing or curing a disease. The following are a few of the common screening procedures, though it is not all-inclusive. An extensive list of screening tests is available at the United States Preventive Services Task Force website at http://www.ahrq.gov/ clinic/uspstfix.htm. Talk with your primary care doctor about making long-term plans for medical screenings for all of the members of your family. Remember that recommendations for screenings change as new tests and new treatments are discovered, and that health organizations and doctors don’t always agree on which tests are useful and how often they should be administered.
    </p>

    <p>
        Feel free to discuss the pros and cons of these guidelines with your doctor. It’s also a good idea to check the most current recommendations on the websites and in the literature of respected organizations. Some examples of reputable organizations are WebMD, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

        Important note: There are certain situations when one experiences very common signs or symptoms, and a simple and inexpensive screening test might help identify a rare but serious problem. Subsequently, the serious illness can then be treated early enough to save the person’s life. An example of this is somebody who is experiencing fatigue, lingering infections, excessive bruising or bleeding, and/or swollen gums. A simple blood test, the CBC (complete blood count), identifies the specific kinds of white blood cells and the red blood cell count. An abnormal result from this simple test in a person with any of the above symptoms might trigger an extensive evaluation resulting in an early diagnosis of leukemia. Unfortunately, people with this disorder are frequently diagnosed too late to receive effective treatment when it will have the greatest benefit.

        <h3>Eyes</h3>
    </div>

    <p><b>Vision</b></p>
    <p>
        Consider going to an eye doctor for an eye exam at least twice between the ages of thirty and forty, or any time you think your vision may be declining. People who use glasses, contacts, or other vision correctors should get their vision retested every year. Also, if you are taking any medications or have a chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension, you should ask your primary care doctor how often you should see an ophthalmologist.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: An ophthalmologist is not the same as an optometrist. An optometrist fits people for glasses and contact lenses, as well as tests for vision and performs many other evaluations of the eye. He or she is also well trained in many other activities relating to eye care. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has extensive training in surgery of the eye, and the medical evaluation and treatment of eye diseases.
    </p>

    <p><b>Glaucoma</b></p>
    <p>
        Many eye doctors recommend that everyone, even if they have no risk factors, be screened once a year after the age of fifty for glaucoma (a condition of increased pressure in the eyes). Risk factors for glaucoma include nearsightedness, a family history of glaucoma, African-American ethnicity, and/or a history of trauma to an eye. Note: Although glaucoma is far more prevalent in older people, it can even appear in kids. The testing can be done easily and painlessly by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.
    </p>

    <p><b>Dental Screening</b></p>
    <p>
        Regular dental checkups and cleanings are recommended at ALL ages every six months.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">

    <p><b>Thyroid Screening</b></p>
    <p>
        A timely diagnosis of thyroid cancer is very important, since it can be cured if detected early. The screening for thyroid cancer involves clinical evaluation by a doctor, who observes and feels the thyroid gland for abnormalities. This is done at the time of a routine physical examination. If irregularities are found, an ultrasound may be requested to further define abnormalities. Various conditions in a person’s history may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, including excess exposure to X-rays. Diagnosing other thyroid diseases such as goiter (an enlarged thyroid), hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), and hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) may require blood tests and/or biopsies.
    </p>

    <p>
        The risk of hypothyroidism increases with age. The American Thyroid Association recommends that all women over thirty-five years of age should be screened for hypothyroidism every five years. Also, women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant should get tested; a mother’s thyroid problems can affect the fetus.

    <p><b>Breast Cancer Screening</b></p>
    <p>
        The key to beating breast cancer is early detection. Knowing what is normal for you may help you identify a lump, so many physicians feel that monthly breast self-exams are valuable. <b><i>However, they should not take the place of mammography so that very small curable cancers are not missed.</i></b> Routine breast exams by a physician are also important. Contact your doctor immediately if you detect a lump in your breast.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following are guidelines for early detection:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every woman should know what her breasts normally feel like, and report any breast changes promptly to her physician. Starting in their twenties, women may choose to perform breast self-exams. (See Appendix B, for instruction on how to perform a breast self-exam.)</li>
        <li>A clinical breast exam performed by the doctor should be part of a woman’s routine health exam. This should happen about every three years for women in their twenties and thirties and every year for women forty years of age or older.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Many doctors recommend that all women should have a mammogram every year, beginning at the age of forty, especially those with a family history of breast cancer. Some health groups recommend getting a baseline mammogram at age thirty-five. Obviously, screenings for breast cancer may not be appropriate if a woman has a short life expectancy because of other medical problems or because she is elderly and frail. In general, survivors of breast cancer should continue to have a mammogram every year, regardless of age.
    </p>

    <p>
        Women at increased risk should start screenings earlier and discuss with their doctor the pros and cons of having additional tests such as an MRI or ultrasound. Women with a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer should be checked for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are genetic mutations linked to these diseases.
    </p>

    <p>Risk factors for breast cancer include:
    <ul>
        <li>a previous history of breast cancer</li>
        <li>a family history of breast cancer (if your mother, sisters, or daughters have had breast cancer, you are at a two to three times greater risk)</li>
        <li>increasing age (85 percent of breast cancers occur after the age of 40 and half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65). Note: Younger women can also get breast cancer.</li>
        <li>exposure to radiation</li>
        <li>not having children</li>
        <li>pregnancy at a late age (usually after 30)</li>
        <li>early menstruation (before the age of 12)</li>
        <li>going through menopause at a later age than normal (usually after 55)</li>
        <li>long-term use of hormone replacement therapy with progesterone as a component</li>
        <li>genetic predisposition (certain mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes)</li>
        <li>the use of oral contraceptives</li>
        <li>the regular consumption of alcohol</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        However, it’s important to remember that the NUMBER 1 RISK FACTOR FOR BREAST CANCER IS BEING A WOMAN. All women need to be conscientious about taking measures for early detection.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>Lung Disease Screening</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        During routine physical checkups your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and take a health history that includes questions about smoking. If you have symptoms of shortness of breath and respiratory problems, your doctor may suggest pulmonary function testing to help diagnose asthma and other lung ailments. This involves breathing in and out of a machine to measure the volume of air that you inhale and exhale.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are a smoker, have been exposed to a lot of asbestos or other toxic airborne substances, or the doctor suspects that you have pneumonia or fluid in your lungs, he/she may recommend that you get a chest X-ray or chest CT scan. There is no uniform opinion concerning how often to get these screening tests or whether it’s valuable to get them at all. There are cases in which these tests—especially the CT scan—have picked up the disease early, allowing for a cure. However, there are also cases where an abnormality is discovered, resulting in invasive diagnostic interventions (with the associated complications from these procedures) that fail to uncover a medical problem.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>Colorectal</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Early Detection of Cancer in the GI Tract</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether you have risk factors or not, routine colorectal screenings are generally recommended starting at a minimum of age fifty. Both men and women without any risk factors should be examined with a colonoscope (colonoscopy) every ten years. Various health committees have recommended other options for screening, such as sigmoidoscopy and barium enemas, but many experts of the GI tract (gastroenterologists) feel that colonoscopies are more likely to identify any cancer.
    </p>

    <p>
        At a minimum, you should get a special test called a fecal occult blood test every year. This is a test that is performed at home at three different times to detect whether there is blood in your stools. It is much less accurate than a colonoscopy, but is also less costly and intrusive. If blood is detected, additional tests are needed. Of course, any test may miss curable cancers, so the decision about which test to use (colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, etc.) as a screen for colon cancer should be made with your personal risk factors in mind. Your doctor can help you decide which test is most appropriate for you.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to undergo screening if you have risk factors including:
    </p>

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>A personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps</li>
        <li>A relative with a history of colorectal cancer or polyps</li>
        <li>A personal history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease</li>
        <li>A polyp or early cancer discovered on a prior colonoscopy</li>
        <li>A family history (mother, father, brother, or sister) of a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome (one of several disorders that usually lead to cancer; namely FAP— Familial Adenomatous Polyposis—which is a condition identified with lots of polyps and can appear in a person as young as five years of age, or HNPCC—Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colon Cancer—which can also start at a relatively young age, but causes few polyps)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Following a routine screening schedule could save your life. Early detection, before you have any warning signs, can improve your chances of being cured of the cancer. This disease is not rare!
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Screening for Kidney Disease</b>
    </p>
    A simple urine dipstick (a strip of paper that turns different colors depending on the contents of the urine) is dipped in a urine sample to detect early kidney disease, particularly in diabetics. A positive result can indicate that you need to go on medication to prevent diabetes-related kidney failure.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>Reproductive System</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Pap Smear/Pelvic Exam</b>
    </p>
    It is important to see a physician (a gynecologist, family physician, or internist) for a thorough pelvic examination on a regular basis in case changes suggestive of cancer occur. The Pap smear is the test used to check for abnormalities of the cervix (the lower opening of the uterus, or womb). It should first be performed the same year that a woman begins to have vaginal intercourse, but no later then when she turns twentyone years of age. After the initial screening, she should get a Pap smear done every year with the regular Pap test and a pelvic exam.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is now a vaccine for HPV (human papilloma virus), which many medical groups recommend, in general, for females between eleven and twenty-six years of age. However, there are other considerations that should be discussed with the doctor. Also, all women should continue to be screened for cervical cancer regardless of whether they get the HPV vaccination.
    </p>

    <p>
        Starting at age thirty, any woman who has had three normal Pap test results and negative HPV (human papilloma virus) tests in a row may choose to be screened every two to three years instead of annually. However, women should continue to be screened every year if they have certain risk factors such as exposure before birth to DES (diethylstilbestrol, a specific type of estrogen), an HIV infection, or a weakened immune system (which could be due to organ transplant therapy, chemotherapy, or chronic steroid use). If a woman has no risk factors, is over the age of seventy, and has had three normal Pap test results in a row along with ten consecutive years without an abnormal Pap test, she may choose to discontinue cervical cancer screenings. Also, a woman of any age who has no risk factors and has had a total hysterectomy (unless it was done as a treatment for cervical cancer or pre-cancer) may want to discuss with her doctor the option of discontinuing her routine Pap smears. However, these women should continue to have their doctor perform a routine exam of the pelvic area.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Pelvic Exam/Ovarian Cancer Screening</b>
    </p>
    Ovarian cancer can sometimes be found during a pelvic exam, but it would be much more valuable to pick it up before it is advanced enough to be detected by the doctor in this way. At the time of the writing of this book, it appears that there is not enough data to come up with an absolute policy of routine ovarian cancer screening. If you are at risk, it may be recommended that you get a more thorough evaluation than the routine pelvic exam. You can assess your risk factors by going to www.wcn.org for a confidential questionnaire. If you are at moderate risk, your doctor may recommend a test known as CA125 radioimmunoassay, and possibly a transvaginal ultrasound. If you are at high risk, you should consider seeing a genetic counselor who is an expert in this area. He/she will likely recommend further testing.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Sexually Transmitted Diseases </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>(Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis)</b>
    </p>
    One of the most important STDs to test for is chlamydia. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, however it’s important to diagnose and treat it because it can—if left untreated—lead to infertility. All sexually active women are at risk and should be screened for it. Additional factors that put women at an even greater risk include sexual activity under the age of twenty-five and high-risk sexual behaviors at any age. High-risk sexual behaviors include multiple partners (or a partner with multiple sexual partners), intercourse without a condom with more than one partner, and shared sex toys. Victimization by sexual assault also increases the risk. Women with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and/or with symptoms of a cervical infection (cervicitis) found during a pelvic exam should be screened for chlamydia as well. Additionally, chlamydia screening is recommended during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy if the woman has had high-risk sexual behavior. Treatment during pregnancy can prevent passing the infection to the newborn.
    </p>

    <p>
        Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis are all becoming more common. Therefore, it is more important than ever for you to regularly get screened for all of these sexually transmitted diseases if you are a sexually active man or woman, especially if you are under the age of thirty-five.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another reason in particular to screen for syphilis is that the symptoms may disappear on their own without treatment, allowing the disease to remain dormant in the body for many years. The reproductive organs may be seriously compromised by syphilis if it is left untreated on a long-term basis. Also, life-threatening complications may appear later in life in those not treated.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note: Of course, all people who have high-risk sexual behaviors should also be screened for HIV/AIDS.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Early Detection of Testicular Cancer</b>
    </p>
    A testicular exam should be part of every man’s routine checkup. Often, testicular cancer can be picked up early by finding a lump. Testicular cancer is most common between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four, but can also occur later in life. Many doctors believe that self-examination of your testicles for lumps once or twice a month beginning at age fourteen may contribute to the early detection of cancer (see Appendix B for instructions on how to perform a self-exam). However, self-examination should not take the place of examination by your doctor as part of your routine physical exam. Men whose testicles did not descend naturally and were surgically placed in their scrotum as babies are at a higher risk of developing testicular cancer. They should let their doctor know so they can be closely monitored. Other risk factors for developing testicular cancer include a family history of this type of cancer or a previous germ cell tumor in one testicle.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Early Detection of Prostate Cancer</b>
    </p>
    African-American men and also men who have first-degree relatives who have had prostate cancer should consider having a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test and digital rectal exam annually beginning at age forty. All other men should begin screening at age fifty. However, there is an ongoing debate among doctors about the advantages of routine PSA screenings. You can have a normal PSA level and have life-threatening prostate cancer. You can also have an elevated PSA level and not have cancer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prostate cancer is much more common in men over sixty years of age. However, when older men get prostate cancer, the cancer will often (but not always) act “old” as well, in that it is slow growing. It is usually less aggressive and less likely to spread and become fatal than in a younger man. Therefore, the younger you are, the more important it is to diagnose it early. (The main reason there are not routine screenings recommended before age fifty is that the cancer is relatively rare in younger men.)
    </p>

    <p>
        African-American men are at higher risk and should consider starting their annual screenings at age forty. Men who have a father, brother, or son who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than sixty-five years old) are at a higher risk and should consider starting screening at age forty or forty-five. Being overweight and eating a high-fat diet are also risk factors.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>Skin</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Melanoma Skin Cancer Screening</b>
    </p>
    If you have a family history of abnormal moles or melanoma, you should have an annual total body skin exam. Other risk factors include fair skin that easily burns, blond or red hair, and/or lots of moles. People with these characteristics should also get annual skin exams. Any time you notice a mole that is changing, appears different, or is very dark, you should have it examined by a dermatologist as soon as possible, since melanomas can spread quickly. (Also, see Tip 155 for further information on the detection of malignant melanomas.) Patients with melanoma skin cancer can be cured if it is caught early enough. Note: In general, the risk of developing skin cancer increases with exposure to the sun, especially under the age of 18.
    </p>

    <div class="subheading">
        <h3>General</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Blood Pressure Screening</b>
    </p>
    High blood pressure puts you at a greater risk of developing health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, and stroke. Your blood pressure is typically checked by your doctor at every checkup. All healthy individuals over twenty-one years of age should be screened regularly—at least every two years—for high blood pressure. However, with childhood obesity on the rise, it is never too early to begin blood pressure screenings. Normal blood pressure is less than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic. If you are an adult with blood pressure that is 120/80 mm Hg or higher, you may need to see a doctor more frequently for blood pressure management and monitoring. If it is only slightly higher than normal (120 to 139 systolic or 80 to 89 diastolic), you have prehypertension, which your doctor will likely try to manage with diet and exercise. And if your blood pressure continues to rise, your doctor may prescribe medications for hypertension. He or she may suggest starting medications sooner if you have preexisting conditions, such as diabetes or kidney disease.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both adults and children can have high blood pressure, but it’s most common in people over thirty-five years old. Risk factors for high blood pressure include race (African Americans are more at risk), age (men often develop it in their thirties, and women after menopause), a close family history of high blood pressure, obesity (a body mass index of 30 or higher), eating too much salt (the recommended salt intake for adults is 2,300 grams or one teaspoon per day), heavy drinking of alcoholic beverages, not getting enough physical activity, and stress. Also people with diabetes, gout, or kidney disease, as well as women who are pregnant, postmenopausal, or taking birth control pills, have a greater chance of having high blood pressure. Anyone at high risk should consider getting screened more often.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, you need to talk to your doctor about how often to have it monitored. Many public places such as shopping malls, drugstores, and fire stations have arm blood pressure machines that are fairly accurate. You can also purchase a blood pressure cuff for home use. Neither of these options should replace routine blood pressure monitoring by your doctor, but they can alert you to an unhealthy spike in blood pressure that may merit more rigorous evaluation and/or treatment. Owning your own blood pressure cuff also allows you to get a series of blood pressure measurements throughout the day. Providing this information to your doctor may be helpful in determining your medical regimen. To ensure accuracy, have your physician check your monitor for you when he/she sees you.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Cholesterol Screening</b>
    </p>
    Healthy men younger than age forty-five and healthy women younger than fifty should be screened for high cholesterol every five years. After the age of forty-five for men and fifty for women, cholesterol levels should be checked every two years. Ideally, this should be done by getting a fasting blood test called a lipoprotein profile (which requires fasting for nine to twelve hours beforehand). This tests for your current levels of total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and triglycerides (other blood fats). A high level of LDL, which is the bad or “lousy” cholesterol, can lead to serious medical problems such as a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. A low HDL, which is the good or “happy” cholesterol, could also contribute to these problems.
    </p>

    <p>
        A family history of high cholesterol and/or a diet high in the bad cholesterol (for example, if you eat too many high-fat animal foods) puts you at a high risk for cholesterol problems. Under these circumstances, you should be screened for high cholesterol more often and eat more foods that help elevate your good cholesterol, such as unsalted nuts and certain kinds of fish (for example, salmon and trout).
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are taking medications for high cholesterol and/or are on a special low-fat diet, and if you have other risk factors for heart disease, your doctor will recommend more frequent cholesterol testing (for example, every six to twelve months). The more risk factors you have, the more likely you will have or family history of heart attacks, coronary stents, or bypass surgery are risk factors for heart disease. Other important risk factors include diabetes, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, high blood pressure (140/90 mm Hg and above, or you are on blood pressure medications), increasing age (forty-five or older for men, fifty or older for women), and/or a combination of risk factors called the metabolic syndrome (most common in middle-aged men with abdominal obesity).
    </p>

    <p>
        Any child who has a close relative with heart disease (for example, a mother, father, or sibling) might benefit from a cholesterol screening at the age of two, and many doctors recommend at least one blood cholesterol screening at age twenty.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Type 2 Diabetes Screening</b>
    </p>
    Anyone at a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes should get screened every three years starting at an early age. Many doctors feel that everybody (even without risk factors) should be routinely tested, starting at least at the age of forty. The doctor orders a fasting glucose test or glucose tolerance test to see if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal. If these levels are high, your treatment plan may include diet, exercise, and/or medications. Detecting diabetes early is important, since it can damage your heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, or blood vessels if it is not treated. Any result over 100 merits physician follow-up at a minimum. Early treatment of this potentially pre-diabetic state is beneficial. The current definition of diabetes is a fasting blood sugar equal to or above 126 mg per dl or two random blood sugars equal to or above 200 mg per dl. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include a family history of diabetes (type 1 or 2), a personal history of gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, inactivity, giving birth to a baby heavier than nine pounds, or certain ethnic backgrounds (African, Hispanic, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander).
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Other Blood Test Screenings</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Some doctors recommend getting a panel of blood tests every five years starting at age fifty. This panel should include tests for blood chemistries as well as for white and red blood counts. There are many ailments that can be picked up with these tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        Obtaining blood in order to check your red blood count to find out if you are anemic simply involves a finger stick. If your red blood count is low, you are anemic. Causes include chronic diseases, poor nutrition, various cancers, or internal bleeding at different locations in the body. While routine testing for anemia is recommended for pregnant patients, a regular schedule for testing the blood count in the general population has not been established. One recommendation is to test your blood count at a minimum of every few years at the time of a physical exam.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Bone Density Screening</b>
    </p>
    Every woman over age sixty (particularly Asian and petite Caucasian women) should be tested for osteoporosis every two years with a bone density test, which consists of a simple low-dose X-ray. Consider beginning routine screenings earlier if you have risk factors for osteoporosis, including a family history of osteoporosis, a low body weight/small body frame, or tobacco use. Also, any woman who has been on steroids or other medications that affect the bones may need to be screened earlier, with more frequent follow-up screenings. There are also many other risk factors for the development of osteoporosis. You should consult your doctor to determine whether preventive treatment is appropriate. Routine screenings are currently only recommended for women, but it’s important to be aware that this disease can also occur in men.
    </p>

        <b>Immunizations</b>
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        The following are some general recommendations for adult vaccinations. These guidelines may vary, depending on your previous immunization history. There is a separate regimen of immunizations for children, which may be recommended by your doctor if you have missed your childhood vaccinations or do not have any record of having received them. A complete listing of the current vaccination schedules for all ages can be found at www.cdc.gov/vaccines. Always check this website because recommendations change. Note: Always let your health provider know of any anaphylactic (life-threatening) allergic reactions to anything before you receive a shot.

    <ul>
        <li>All adults need a booster for tetanus and diphtheria every ten years. It’s also recommended to get a TDAP vaccination (for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis/ whooping cough) once between the ages of eleven and sixty-four years old.</li>
        <li>There is now a vaccine for HPV (human papilloma virus), which is recommended in general by many medical groups for females between eleven and twenty-six years of age. However, there are other considerations that should be discussed with the doctor.</li>
        <li>College students are required to be assessed for a number of vaccinations such as tetanus, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), varicella (chicken pox), and hepatitis B. These assessments are based on age, living situation, and—in special cases—their major. For example, a dorm-living freshman is often required to get a meningococcal vaccination, and veterinarian students are required to get vaccinated for rabies.</li>
        <li>There are many medical organizations that recommend that you get a flu shot every year if you suffer from a chronic disease, or if you are fifty years of age or older. Women who are over three months pregnant during flu season, as well as people with babies in the home or caregivers of children, should also consider getting the flu shot. College students may benefit from a flu shot, especially if they live in a dorm. Also, people who spend a lot of time around the sick and elderly (such as caregivers and health-care workers) should get the flu vaccine.</li>
        <li>Every older adult should talk to his or her doctor about getting pneumococcal and Herpes Zoster immunizations.</li>

        <b>Body-Mass Index</b></p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Height and weight should be checked as part of every regular physical examination in order to screen for obesity.

        <h3>Pediatric Health Screenings</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
        Starting at birth, it’s important for every child to be taken to his or her pediatrician or family physician for regular checkups. At their physical checkups, all kids should have their vital signs checked. They should also get their immunizations and have their growth and development tracked. Besides these routine health checks, there are a number of very important standard screenings every child should have. These include the following:

    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Eyes</b>
    </p>
    Children younger than three years of age should have their eyes screened at each checkup with their primary care physician, using the red reflex test. Another important screening test is where the doctor alternately covers and uncovers each eye. These tests can identify serious eye problems that are treatable when caught early. Starting at three years of age, vision should be checked once a year using standard picture or letter optotypes. At any age: If one or both eyes constantly cross or the red reflex looks different between the eyes in photos, the child should have a complete eye exam by an ophthalmologist.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Ears</b>
    </p>
    At ages four and five, hearing should be checked. For a hearing screening, an odeometer is used to play sounds at different frequencies. The child is usually asked to wear headphones and raise his/her hand on whichever side he or she hears a beep.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also a variety of tests you can do at home to monitor your child’s hearing. If the child is under two years old, you can test their “startle response” by slapping your hand on a table when they aren’t looking. Watch to see if they jump at the noise. If the child is between two and four years old, turn on one of their toys that makes noise and keep it hidden from their view. Watch to see if they look in that direction. If the child is between four and six years old, monitor whether the child responds when asked questions.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Dental Exams</b>
    </p>
    The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends taking your child for his or her first dental checkup when his/ her first tooth appears or when he or she turns one year old. The dentist will examine the child’s mouth to make sure the gums and teeth are healthy, as well as give the parents guidance about helping the child develop good dental hygiene habits. This initial visit also begins to familiarize the child with being in the dental chair. Speak to the dentist about appropriate follow-up visits.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Scoliosis</b>
    </p>
    Around the age of puberty (eleven to thirteen), all children should be screened for scoliosis. This involves having the child stand in different positions and postures to measure the curvature of the spine. Most schools now provide scoliosis screenings for all students around the age of puberty.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Immunizations</b>
    </p>
    The National Immunization Program (part of the CDC) provides the best resource for current immunization schedules as well as other important issues relating to vaccinations at www.cdc.gov/vaccines/.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Blood Tests</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>At ages one and two all children should have their hematocrit checked (to screen for anemia: a low blood count). The hematocrit test measures the proportion of red blood cells in the individual’s total blood content.</li>
        <li>If there’s a family history of high cholesterol and/or heart disease, consider having your child’s blood cholesterol level checked at age two. Many doctors recommend that every child get screened before he or she reaches adolescence, or at least once at age twenty.</li>
        <li>Consider having your child’s blood tested for lead content, especially if you live in an older home. Lead poisoning can contribute to growth problems, learning disabilities, and anemia in children. Most lead poisoning in children results from ingesting paint chips or dirt contaminated with lead, which was an ingredient used in house paint prior to 1977.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Type 2 Diabetes</b>
    </p>
    Considering the growing diabetes epidemic and how diabetes is becoming more common in children, many public health experts are suggesting that children with weight problems be closely monitored for this disease. Risk factors include obesity, having a close relative with type 2 diabetes, ethnicity (Native American, African American, Hispanic American, or Asian/South Pacific Island ancestry), and existing conditions that may indicate insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, dyslipidemia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, etc.). Parents can lower a child’s risk of developing diabetes by encouraging healthy eating habits and activity choices.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Alcohol and Drug Use</b>
    </p>
    Between the ages of eleven and twenty-one, juveniles should be assessed for the risk of developing alcohol and drug abuse patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Depression and Thoughts of Suicide</b>
    </p>
    Screening teenagers for their mental health should be a routine part of the adolescent history and physical exam. Suicide is the third most common cause of death among teenagers. Early identification and treatment of depression is thought to be the most effective way to prevent this tragedy. Between the ages of eleven and thirteen, children should spend quality time with their doctor, developing a safe environment to ask questions and seek help. The physician can screen for drug, alcohol, sexual, and mental factors.

    <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Screenings for Older Adults</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>All older adults should be screened regularly for thyroid function, vitamin B12 deficiencies, vitamin D deficiencies, anemia, obesity, unintentional weight loss, alcoholism, vision and hearing deficits, osteoporosis, incontinence, and pain.</li>
        <li>Some doctors suggest that older adults be screened for dementia (including Alzheimer’s) and depression.</li>
        <li>Screening for increased risk of falls can be valuable for the elderly population. This involves taking the patient’s history in addition to observing him or her while he/she performs simple actions like sitting down, rising from a seated position, and walking.</li>
        <li>At each medical checkup, older adults should make sure that the doctor reviews all the drugs being prescribed by their treating physicians. They should bring all their pill bottles with them to all their doctors’ visits.</li>
        <li>Every older adult should get an annual influenza vaccination, as well as the pneumococcal vaccine every five years, and a tetanus booster every ten years. The CDC has also recommended that seniors get immunized for Herpes Zoster.</li>
        <li>Routine visits to the dentist continue to be important with increasing age.</li>
        <li>Some doctors recommend that all men who have ever smoked should be scanned once between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-five for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Optional Screenings</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
        You may want to ask your doctor about the following optional screenings, with the knowledge that certain tests are not without risks themselves. Obviously, you must also factor in the cost of any test.
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Aneurysm  Screening</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>An ultrasound of the aorta (a picture taken with sound waves of the aorta in the abdomen) screens for aneurysms. Aneurysms are more commonly found in those who have high blood pressure, have smoked cigarettes for five years (or longer), or have family members who have had aneurysms.</li>
        <li>An exercise stress test (EKG) can detect serious heart disease.</li>
        <li>A nuclear stress test is very accurate at detecting heart disease, but is one of the more expensive tests.</li>
        <li>A “quick echo” (sound wave study) of the heart may be helpful for the early detection of serious heart disease in athletes.</li>
        <li>Calcium scoring of the coronary arteries with a special type of CT scan may pick up early heart disease.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    <p>
        <b>Stroke Prevention</b>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>An ultrasound of the carotid arteries may help to screen for blood vessel blockages that may cause a stroke. However, many doctors only recommend these tests for patients with symptoms that suggest a risk of stroke, such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).</li>

    </ul>
