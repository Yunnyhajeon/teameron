            Indigestion may be a sign of a heart attack. You should be especially concerned about:
            <br>•	Indigestion with exercise or exertion
            <br>•	Indigestion with a dizzy sensation
            <br>•	Indigestion with a cold sweat
            <br>•	Indigestion with numbness or pain radiating to the jaw or shoulder
            <br>•	Indigestion with pressure in the chest
            <br>•	Indigestion that does not respond to the usual medicines

                Most of the time indigestion is not a serious disorder. But sometimes it can be a symptom of a heart attack. Though it is more often serious when associated with other symptoms, as listed above, it can still be the red light warning signal of a heart attack when it appears alone.

            <p>
                Under the above circumstances an immediate visit to the emergency room may save your life.

            If you have long-term heartburn and belching  that does not respond to an antacid or ulcer medication, it can lead to ulcers, bleeding, and/or narrowing of the esophagus (which may predispose you to cancer).

                The tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach is called the esophagus. When food backs up from the stomach into the esophagus (reflux) and the esophagus becomes irritated, you may develop heartburn. This condition often responds to an antacid or ulcer medication. However, if you have heartburn for weeks and it does not respond to conventional treatment, it is important to have it evaluated by your doctor.
