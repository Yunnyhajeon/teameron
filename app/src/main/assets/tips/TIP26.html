            Hearing the sound of your heartbeat inside your head, usually in association with episodic headaches, could
            mean that you have a blood vessel malformation capable of causing a stroke.

                It is common to hear your heartbeat in your ear when you lie down and place your ear against a pillow.
                But if you notice the onset of pulsating noise similar to a beating heart on one side of your head, and
                if it is constantly present no matter how your body is positioned, it is abnormal. It could indicate a
                problem with your ear or a blood vessel abnormality inside your head or neck (particularly if it is in
                association with episodic throbbing headaches on one side of your head).

                The rare type of blood vessel abnormality most likely to produce this heartbeat sound is called a dural
                arteriovenous malformation. Under normal circumstances, veins carry blood to the heart, while arteries
                carry blood away from it. This abnormality, often present at birth, is caused by the direct connection
                of an artery to a vein, which significantly increases blood pressure in the veins. As time passes, these
                malformations may get larger and begin producing the heartbeat sound with such intensity that it can be
                heard in the ear closest to the malformation.

                If you experience these symptoms, seek medical evaluation by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. A blood
                vessel malformation may need to be repaired so it will not rupture and cause a brain hemorrhage. A tumor
                is another possible cause of these symptoms. A rare cause is a partial blockage of an artery in the
                neck. A more common cause is rapid or turbulent blood flow in the veins around the ear.
