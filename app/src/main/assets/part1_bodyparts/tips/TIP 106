            Red light warning signals of a rare but serious infection called toxic shock syndrome are lower belly pain and a high fever, often with a bright red rash  spreading  from  mid-body  to  all  over the body, and a “strawberry”-appearing tongue. Any severe vaginal infection (sometimes associated with the use of tampons) may lead to this ailment.
