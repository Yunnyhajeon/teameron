            If your child experiences a head injury, is initially fine, and then becomes abnormally drowsy, vomits or develops other symptoms within hours or sometimes even days following an injury, he or she may be experiencing bleeding inside the head. This is an emergency! Any loss of consciousness, even for a short period of time, requires immediate medical evaluation.

<p>
                After a significant injury to the head, slow bleeding may start inside the skull, and the child may gradually get drowsy due to the increasing pressure within his or her head. If your child injures his/her head and initially seems fine, observe him/her closely for at least the next two or three days. This includes waking the child every hour for the first six hours following the injury to make sure he/she has not lost consciousness, and then every four hours for the next eighteen hours. Go to the hospital emergency room or call an ambulance (911 in most locations) if your child gets more drowsy, experiences weakness or jerking on one side of the body, and/or develops double vision, personality changes, speech problems, loss of sensation, seizures, dizziness, a headache, or any other major changes (see Tip 10 for more information on head injuries). If your child has lost consciousness, even for a short period of time, have him or her evaluated immediately.
