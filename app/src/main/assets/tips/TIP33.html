<p>
                At an early stage, mucosal melanoma can appear as a blue or black spot or a nonpigmented growth, usually on the roof of the mouth or on the gums around your front upper teeth. Other more common causes of a blue or black spot include stains from silver fillings.

                A dentist or doctor, oral surgeon, or ear, nose, and throat physician can help determine the cause of your gum discoloration.
