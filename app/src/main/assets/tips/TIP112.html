            A usually painless lump or swelling in your testicle with or without a small lump in the groin could be serious. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men. Most cases of testicular cancer are found between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four. However, they can occur later in life as well. Note: Testicular cancer is more commonly found in men whose testicle(s) did not naturally descend from the abdomen to the scrotum within the first year of life. On the other hand, swelling, severe pain, and/or tenderness of the testicle can be the signs of another serious condition requiring emergency   care.

                If you notice a nonpainful, hard lump or swelling in your testicle, you need to see your physician for evaluation for testicular cancer as soon as possible. An ultrasound exam is an easy, painless way of detecting a tumor in the testicles.

                Normally, within the first year of life, your testicles descend from your abdomen to your scrotum. If one or both do not descend, then your testicle(s) is surgically taken from your abdomen and placed in your scrotum. If this was the case with you, then you are at a higher risk of developing testicular cancer, even in the testicle that descended naturally. Let your doctor know so that he or she can monitor you closely. Other risk factors of developing testicular cancer include a family history of this type of cancer or a previous germ cell tumor in one testicle.

                Many doctors believe that a self-examination of your testicles for lumps once or twice a month, beginning at puberty, may contribute to the early detection of cancer. However, self-examinations should not take the place of examination of the testicles by your doctor as part of your routine general physical exam. Discovering and treating testicular cancer at an early stage may save your life. Cure rates can be as high as 90 percent, depending on the type of cancer. (See Appendix B for instructions on self-examination and Appendix C, for information about routine medical screening.)

                Another cause of swelling in the testicle may be testicular torsion, in which the cord within the testicle gets twisted, cutting off blood supply to that area. This condition may also cause sudden and severe pain or tenderness. It can result from an injury to the testicles or strenuous activity, or it may occur spontaneously for no apparent reason. This is a true emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Treatment usually involves corrective surgery. If the blood supply is cut off for a long time, the testicle may be permanently damaged and may require removal. It is very difficult to save the testicles after six hours without treatment.
