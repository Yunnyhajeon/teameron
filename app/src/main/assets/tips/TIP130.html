            Discomfort and burning during urination, the recurrent feeling that you need to urinate, and frequent urination are all symptoms of a bladder infection. Repeated urinary tract infections may indicate a blockage in the plumbing system of your body and may cause kidney failure.

<p>
                Bladder infections cause spasms resulting in frequent urination, a recurrent feeling that you need to urinate, and/or burning discomfort on urination. These infections are common and are treatable with antibiotics. Note: Women are more likely to have urinary tract infections. Due to the shortness of a womanâ€™s urethra (the tube connecting the bladder to the outside), a germ can enter her bladder more easily.
            </p>
<p>
                If a man has more than one urinary tract infection or if a woman has more than two in a row, there is an increased likelihood that an abnormality is impeding the free flow of urine. The abnormality may be in the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureter), in the bladder itself, or in the urethra.
            </p>
<p>
                A bladder infection that does not respond to antibiotic therapy is another red light warning signal. Anything that blocks, delays, or reverses the flow of urine can lead to a urinary tract infection that will recur unless the altered flow pattern is corrected.
            </p>
<p>
                Examples of such defects include:
                <ul>
<li>Kidney stones in the kidney or in the ureter (the tube that goes from the kidney to the bladder)</li>
<li>A kink in the ureter</li>
<li>A growth in any adjacent organ pressing on the ureter</li>
<li>Vesico-ureteral reflux, a condition that allows urine to reverse its flow from the bladder back up into the ureter</li>
<li>An abnormal valve in the urethra that partially blocks the urine flow from the bladder (most often seen in young boys)</li>
<li>Urethral stricture, or narrowing of the urethra</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                If these problems continue uncorrected, they may cause recurrent kidney infections, resulting in kidney failure, the need to be routinely connected to a kidney machine (dialysis), or a kidney transplant.
            </p>
<p>
                Other causes of repeated urinary tract infections include disorders of the immune system and diabetes, which also require treatment.
            </p>
<p>
                If you experience painful, burning, or frequent urination, you should see a doctor as soon as possible. Recurrent bladder infections or poor response to therapy indicate that you need a thorough evaluation by a urologist (surgical kidney specialist).
