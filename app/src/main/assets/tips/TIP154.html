            If you notice a serious skin sensitivity to the sun, check the side effects of the medicines you are taking. Other possible causes include lupus and other diseases.

                Hundreds of medicines can make your skin sensitive to the sun. There are two main types of reactions:
                <ul>
<li><b>Phototoxic reaction.</b> This type of reaction occurs immediately after you begin taking the offending medication, because it causes the skin to be much more sensitive to the ultraviolet light of the sun. This can create such an intense sun sensitivity that a normally harmless amount of sunlight may burn your skin.</li>
<li><b>Photoallergic reaction.</b> This type of reaction is due to an allergic sensitization of the skin by a drug. It appears after being on the medicine for a while (24 to 72 hours, or even as long as a few weeks). Skin exposed to the sun may develop eczema, hives, small fine bumps, hard plaques, or blisters. There is a chance that these reactions will continue to recur for some time after the drug has been discontinued.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                Note: Even visits to sun-tanning salons can cause these symptoms.
            </p>
<p>
                Since so many different medicines can cause these reactions, consult your doctor to determine if a drug you are taking may have these side effects. You can also consult with your pharmacist and ask for a copy of all of the package inserts for the medicines you are taking (both prescription and nonprescription) to see if skin sensitivity to the sun is a side effect, and, indeed, if there are any other side effects.
            </p>
<p>
                Both phototoxic and photoallergic reactions can be very serious and may even be fatal. If you develop a reaction, you should discuss it with your doctor as soon as possible to determine the safest way to deal with it (for example, by changing medicines). Donâ€™t make these decisions alone.
