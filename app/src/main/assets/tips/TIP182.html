            If someone has passed out, it is extremely important to know whether they lost consciousness because of a seizure. Seizures can be recurrent and warrant specific treatment. They can also be a sign of an abnormality in the brain or an emergency life-threatening condition such as very low blood sugar or a serious electrolyte abnormality in the blood.

               A seizure means there has been a sudden alteration of the electrical function of the brain that produces a sudden change in behavior. A seizure can occur in a normal brain if its metabolism is disturbed, such as with low blood sugar, lack of oxygen, low sodium, high fever, or certain drugs.

                A generalized convulsive (grand mal) seizure involves a sudden loss of consciousness with rhythmic jerking of the entire body, which can also be accompanied by biting of the tongue, and urination, followed by a period of sleep before regaining consciousness. However, not all seizures follow this pattern.
            </p>

                Seizures occur in a variety of ways, since the brain has so many different functions. The spectrum is so wide that   it ranges from merely experiencing a strange smell to acting funny. If the electrical currents released by your brain are less intense and are confined to a small area of the brain, a minor seizure will occur. The results of this minor seizure depend on the area of the brain involved. For example, you may just smack your lips or stare without being aware that you are doing anything.

                The term “epilepsy” refers to a chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, which is either inherited or acquired. It usually, but not always, begins in childhood. The seizures caused by epilepsy may continue throughout life.
            </p>

                The first phase of a seizure is sometimes a special feeling called an “aura,” which may be an unusual smell, a rising sensation in the belly, or just not feeling right. The seizure—major or minor—is in turn followed by confusion, lack of memory of the event, fatigue, and sometimes a period of deep sleep, often with heavy snoring, before normal behavior re- turns. This sequence of events—aura, altered consciousness (with or without jerking), followed by a period of sleep or changed awareness—distinguishes seizures from fainting or other causes of sudden unconsciousness. The jerking phase of a seizure usually lasts only a few minutes, while the period of post-seizure sleeping and/or symptoms such as fatigue, muscle soreness, confusion, combativeness, or agitation may last much longer. If the jerking phase does not stop after several minutes, or if it keeps recurring, and the person does not be- gin returning to his or her normal self, the condition is life- threatening. Call an ambulance.

                If you witness a person who is having a seizure lose consciousness, turn them on their side, away from dangerous objects. Do not attempt to put anything in their mouth. Call for emergency care, unless the person is a known epileptic and you have been advised otherwise.
            </p>

                A common cause of seizures in children is a high fever. As the brain matures into adulthood, it becomes less susceptible to this happening. (See Tip 201 for more information on seizures due to fevers in children.)
            </p>
<p>
                Seizures can also result from a brain injury, brain tumor, stroke, a life-threatening low or high blood sugar level, abnormal electrolyte levels in the blood (such as one might experience after prolonged vomiting), or a sudden loss of blood flow to your brain. These conditions all need to be treated on an emergency basis, so all first-time seizures require an immediate visit to the emergency room to determine the underlying cause or causes.
            </p>

                Seizures can sometimes occur without an apparent cause. A normal adult with no previous history of seizures, no family history of epilepsy, and no current illness can suddenly have a major seizure. What do you do if medical tests do not reveal any cause? You will often need to take medicine to control the seizures, since you cannot risk a recurrence while driving or in another potentially dangerous situation. If you have not had a seizure in many years, you should discuss with your doctor whether you should continue to take the seizure medicine. Only your doctor can make this judgment, based on your individual circumstances.
            </p>
                In most states, driving is not permitted for up to six months after a seizure. It is also important to take other safety precautions, such as avoiding heights (not using ladders, climbing trees, working on rooftops), avoiding swimming or taking baths unsupervised (showers are safer), and avoiding being in front of open flames (such as campfires and barbecues).
