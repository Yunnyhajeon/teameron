                            <li>The victim begins breathing on his/her own.</li>

                <b>Good Samaritan Laws</b>
                <p>
                    In the United States of America, in most cases the Good Samaritan law covers any individual who attempts to help a person in need. There are four main points to keep in mind when you step in to help:
                </p>
                <ul>
                            <li>You must be reasonably careful and not purposely try to hurt someone.</li>
                            <li>Act in “good faith.” You cannot be paid or rewarded for your service.</li>
                            <li>Do not try to provide care beyond your skill level.</li>
                            <li>Once you have begun to help, you are expected to stay with the victim and continue providing aid until someone of equal or higher training takes over, unless the scene or situation becomes dangerous for you.</li>
