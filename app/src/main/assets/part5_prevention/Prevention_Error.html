                <p>
                Do you need to worry about medical errors when you’re sick in the hospital? The Institute of Medicine, a group of medical authorities monitoring quality of health care, says that you do. In 1999 this organization released a report revealing that 48,000 to 98,000 patients die each year from medical errors occurring in the nation’s hospitals. This announcement shocked health-care providers and patients, prompting a much closer look at the health-care delivery system. Patients, insurance companies, the government, and other groups demanded changes to decrease these errors.
                </p>
                <p>
                Additional investigation determined that the infrastructure of the health-care delivery system has not kept up with rapidly advancing medical technology. While the wonders of modern medicine have indeed reduced suffering and death, these same advances have made treatments more complex. Indeed, medical advancements have resulted in a dramatic increase in the variety and volume of interventions, such that there are greater odds for hospital staff to make mistakes. For example, if five physicians in the hospital are doing a procedure or treating an illness differently, the hospital staff must learn and remember how to do a task five different ways.
                </p>
                <p>
                Fortunately, death rates from errors in hospitals are declining because of innovative efforts by hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies to improve quality control. However, there is more work to be done. A major positive step is to improve patient education. An informed patient can take a more active role in maintaining the quality of his or her health care. Be pleasant, but don’t be shy about expressing your concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                The following tips are provided to empower patients and help them protect themselves from errors that commonly occur in hospitals. These tips are based on recommendations from the National Patient Safety Goals advocated by the Institute of Medicine, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. If you are a patient in the hospital or are helping a friend or relative in the hospital, you will benefit from reviewing these tips.

                    Make sure help is available: Rapid physician response to a sudden change in a patient’s condition can save lives.
                </div>

                <div class="body_contents">
                    There are teams of doctors and nurses specifically assigned to respond to any change in a patient’s condition long before he/ she experiences cardiac arrest and a “code” is called. However, a significant change in a patient’s condition may be missed by the nursing staff. Inquire about the availability of rapid response teams and how they can be accessed if the family identifies a problem. If a rapid response program does not exist at your hospital, suggest that they implement one.

                    If you observe anything that is occurring that isn’t right or appears questionable, “stop the line.”
                </div>

                <div class="body_contents">
                    <p>
                        Every hospital should have a “stop the line” policy that clearly states that when anyone observes an event involving the care of a patient that is, or appears to be, in error, they should immediately notify the floor nurse, who should “stop the line”.  This means that every activity involving that patient should stop until whatever is in question is resolved. Ask and make sure that this is a hospital policy. You and/or your advocates should use it when it’s necessary. For example, if a nurse brings in a medicine for you that appears to be different from what you have been taking, you should question the change. If the nurse then discovers a mistake has been made, he or she should “stop the line” to find out why. Maybe there is someone with the same name or a similar name on the hospital floor. In this case, the error could happen again if the necessary precautions are not taken. Make certain that if there is an actual error, its cause has been resolved. If possible, this should be done before care measures are resumed. In such a case, special identifiers should be put in place. For example, a note might be placed on the front of the chart and/or on the door of the room.
                    </p>
                    Note: Sometimes the same generic medicine is manufactured as pills that look different.

                        For over a century it was the custom to shave a body area prior to surgery at that site. A recent study found that this method of hair removal actually increases the incidence of wound infection. So what now?
                    </p>
                    The proper way to prepare a site for surgery is to clip the hair instead of shaving it. So, if someone comes at you with a razor, ask them to use clippers instead. This may seem like a small point, but it is important. One-hundred-year-old customs do not die easily.

                        When two patients in the hospital have the same name, or even names that look similar, there is a greater chance of error. You are especially at risk if there is another patient with the same name or a similar name in the treatment area (hospital floor) where you are located.
                    </p>
                    How do you find out if this is the case during your hospital stay? Simply ask the nurse who is caring for you. If the answer is yes, then ask if the hospital has a system for alerting staff members to the coincidence of two patients having similar names. If they don’t, then request special identifiers such as name alerts (which are often either stickers on written charts or red labels on electronic files). In certain cases, it might even be wise to ask to be moved to another area of the hospital. If the nursing staff refuses to cooperate, notify the CEO’s office. There are strict patient privacy rules, but you don’t need to know the identity of the other person to prevent a situation of name confusion. All you need to do is request that the increased risk be addressed.

                        Miscommunication among physicians, nurses, and hospital personnel is a major cause of medical errors. Ask your doctor what his/her schedule is and which doctor covers for him/her on off hours. Make sure that all of the doctors who are caring for you know why you are in the hospital, as well as what your diagnostic and treatment plans are, particularly during the next twenty-four hours.

                        When you are taken from your hospital room, make sure to ask where you’re being taken and why. When you arrive at another location, ask what is to be done. Make sure all the answers from the different practitioners are consistent. Also, upon any visit to the ER, make sure that your own medical specialist(s) is contacted and advised or consulted with if you have a past medical history relating to your current condition.

                        Ask the nurse who is administering your medication to identify each medicine you are being given. Remember the appearance of each one, even if you have to write it down. If you are offered something that looks different from what you have previously been given, ask what it is. Bear in mind that there are some situations with generic medications where the same medicine comes in a different shape or color. If your prescriptions have been changed, ask why. Learn about all of your medications, why you are taking them, what drugs or foods they should not be taken with, when they should be taken (with or without meals), and what the potential side effects are. Errors relating to medication are the most frequent mistakes made in the hospital. The consequences of taking the wrong medicine can be very serious.

                Pneumonia and flu can be contracted from other patients while you are in the hospital. This is particularly dangerous (and there is a higher risk of a resulting fatality) if you are   elderly.

                    Reduce the risk of developing pneumonia and influenza. Particularly if you are elderly, make sure that you are up-to-date on all your vaccinations, and that you are not placed in a room with anyone who is infectious. Many doctors recommend that hospitalized patients take a few deep breaths and cough to clear their airway every hour or so. Some doctors even prescribe the use of a spirometer to facilitate deep breathing. It is felt that these measures decrease the risk of developing infections in the lungs. (See Tip 72 for more on pneumonia.)

                <p>

                If you have ever had a blood clot, you are at an increased risk of having another, no matter why you are in the hospital. Discuss this with your physician immediately upon being admitted to the hospital, since you may need anticoagulation (blood thinning) to prevent a recurrence. This treatment is called deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Note: There are a few rare situations in which active bleeding could prohibit this strategy.
            </div>

            <div class="body_contents">
                <p>
                    A previous blood clot is not the only reason that you might need a blood thinner while you are in the hospital. An immobilizing illness and prolonged bed confinement both increase your risks of getting a blood clot, whether you have had one before or not. Therefore, if your condition is serious and you are bound to your hospital bed, it might be a good idea for you to start prophylactic anticoagulation (blood-thinning medication). Another reason you might want this preventative therapy is if you are massively obese. Since massively obese people have poor circulation, they are more likely to develop blood clots.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The use of prophylactic anticoagulation is also extremely important after certain surgical procedures. Orthopedic procedures are at the top of this list. Almost any operation on a major bone, such as hip replacement or knee replacement, warrants anticoagulation. Discuss this with your doctor before and after your admission to the hospital, as well as before and after your operation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The mortality from blood clots is quite high, so it is well worth your effort to take every possible step to prevent them. There are a number of simple measures for reducing the risk of developing blood clots, which include getting out of bed and walking around intermittently, if tolerated. There are also intermittent compression devices that your doctor may prescribe if appropriate. These are placed around the legs to squeeze and massage the calves, and thus improve circulation. (For more on blood clots, see Tips 64 and 81.)

                In certain surgical cases, taking the right antibiotic within one hour before your skin is surgically cut will reduce your likelihood of getting an infection.
            </div>

            <div class="body_contents">
                This very important discovery was made by investigators reviewing two million cases in the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. It is so important that it has become the standard of care in all American hospitals. Make sure that the proper antibiotic is given if you are having one of certain surgical procedures performed, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Blood vessel surgery</li>
                    <li>Colon/large intestine surgery</li>

                    <li>Knee joint replacement surgery</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The proper use of preoperative antibiotics involves two steps. Number one: selecting the appropriate antibiotic for the anticipated surgical procedure, taking into account the patient’s history of medication allergies. Number two: making absolutely sure that it is given within one hour of the actual surgical incision. Sometimes the antibiotic is given in the operating room. If it is given too early or after the skin is cut, its effectiveness is lost.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This seems simple enough. You would expect it to happen 100 percent of the time or at least nearly 100 percent. Not so. The compliance to this required safety measure is often as low as 60 percent in some hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Discuss the use of antibiotics with your surgeon before you go to the hospital, and consider insisting that the surgery not be performed without it. If it comes time to cut and the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic has not been given to you an hour earlier, it may be necessary to reschedule the surgery, unless delaying it could cause serious health problems.

                        Make sure that you know if you are being given any medication that may increase your risk of falling. If additional medication is added to your treatment plan, ask again whether these additional medications might make you dizzy or lightheaded when taken in combination with your current medications. If you begin to feel unsteady, call for help before moving about. Ask whether your medications can be altered to decrease these side effects
