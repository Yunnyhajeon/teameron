            If you have a pulsating bulge in your belly (more noticeable in a person of slender to medium build), it may mean that the aorta, the main vessel coming out of your heart, is ballooning out (aortic aneurysm). This is life-threatening if it leaks or bursts. It may also cause abrupt and/or worsening pain in the lower back, the side, or the abdomen. Sometimes the legs can turn blue and develop some pain. Often, an aneurysm is painless until it begins to leak and/or rupture.
