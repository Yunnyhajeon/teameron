            If your son learned to walk late, falls frequently, and/or has difficulty walking, standing up from a sitting position, or going up stairs, you must take him to a doctor to make sure he does not have a muscular dystrophy such as Duchenne's.

<p>
                The most common muscular dystrophy occurs only in boys (about one in every 2,500 male births). Many cases are in families with no previous history of this condition.
            </p>
<p>
               The afflicted boy is usually slow at learning to walk (over eighteen months old) and has difficulty climbing stairs or getting into the car. He may get up from sitting on the floor by climbing up his legs (e.g., holding onto his legs to pull himself up). He may waddle as he walks and tend to fall a lot. His tongue and calf muscles may look bigger than normal. This condition may also have associated learning difficulties. Treatment is supportive rather than curative, and thus the most important measures will be to improve quality of life. Early diagnosis also allows for genetic counseling about future pregnancies.
