            Freckles on the lips, in the mouth, or on the inside of the lips are associated with growths in the intestines, which can become cancerous (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).

<p>
                In the unusual, inherited condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, freckles occur on the lips and on the inside of the mouth. They may be present at birth, develop over time, or even disappear over time. It is important to determine whether they are associated with dangerous polyps (growths) in the intestines.
            </p>
<p>
                If you have freckles that follow this pattern, an evaluation by a doctor may be appropriate to find and remove any polyps. This may help you to avoid intestinal bleeding and to prevent cancerous growths. Sometimes the polyps may already be malignant, in which case early surgical removal can be curative.

                Let your doctor know if you have this warning signal, especially if you have a family member who has had cancer of the colon. (See Tip 226 for more information on this disorder in children.)
