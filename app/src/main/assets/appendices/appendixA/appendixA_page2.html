                <p><b>IN THE CASE OF PREGNANCY OR   OBESITY</b></p>
In pregnant or obese persons, you may need to place your hands or arms at the location of the chest, that is, the center of the breastbone, instead of below the rib cage. If you are unable to get your arms around the person from behind, you can have them put their back against a wall, and you can provide the thrusts directly to the front of the chest. Give up to five rapid, firm chest thrustsâ€”either from behind or from the front.

            </p>

                <p><b>IF YOU ARE ALONE AND CHOKING</b></p>
Find a hard, blunt edge (for example, the back of a chair or the edge of a countertop), and drop yourself onto it, so that the edge strikes you between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage. Repeat the action until the object is dislodged.

Pick up a telephone (if available) and dial 911. A regular landline telephone is better than a cell phone; in most cases, emergency services will be able to track your location from the call, even if you are unable to speak. If you must use a cell phone, be sure to give them your exact location immediately if you are still able to speak.

                    Some paragraphs will have lists. To insert a list:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Item1</li>
                            <li>Item2</li>
                            <li>Item3</li>
                        </ul>

                    ex: <p> My list is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Item1</li>

                            </ul>
