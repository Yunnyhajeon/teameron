            Unexplained and persistent bone pain, particularly if it wakes you in the middle of the night, warrants evaluation by a doctor. It may be cancer originating in the bone or another cancer that has spread to the bones.

                You need to be able to distinguish this deep, aching kind of bone pain from pains in the joints, which are usually due to overexertion or arthritis. In the early stages of bone cancer, the pain may be intermittent, but it will often get worse at night. As the cancer develops, the pain will become more severe and constant, and may also worsen with movement.
            </p>

                Cancer originating in the bone can involve the bone itself or the core of the bone where blood cells are made. It is best to have these serious problems ruled out when you have severe bone pain before seeking therapies such as spinal adjustments, manipulations, acupuncture, etc. Early treatment of cancer can make a difference in your outcome.
