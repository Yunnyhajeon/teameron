            The bite of a tick can cause staggering, a lack of coordination, or even paralysis. These symptoms usually clear when the tick is removed.

                A tick bite on the back of the neck near the base of the skull can cause “tick paralysis.” The tick attaches, burrows its head through the skin, feeds on your blood, and regurgitates a toxin into your skin.

                If you stagger and become uncoordinated for no apparent reason, examine the back of your neck and other parts of your body for a tick. Whether or not you find one, it is important to seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment if you have these symptoms. If you do find a tick, it is important to remove the entire insect. This can be done by putting alcohol on the tick to relax it, and then stretching the skin and pulling the tick off with tweezers. Doctors recommend placing the tweezers at the base of the head (where the neck would be) pulling gently, and the tick should become loose.
