            A sudden change in personality may not be the result of a primary psychiatric disorder but may occur as a result of chemical changes in the blood or as a side effect of certain medications. Personality changes can also be caused by tumors, a brain injury (which may be unwitnessed),  a stroke, a seizure, decreased oxygen, or bleeding in the brain.

                A sudden change in personality—including anxiety, apathy, confusion, bizarre or paranoid thoughts, excessive energy (mania), and irritability—may be one of the body’s red light warning signals of a treatable chemical or physical abnormality in the body, including the brain. It is important to seek medical evaluation in order to treat the underlying illness. In many cases, medical treatment can reverse the personality disorder. (See Tip 11 about combativeness after a head injury.)
