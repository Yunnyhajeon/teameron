            Any blood in the urine, even without pain, can signify a serious problem. Even if it’s  just  one short episode and then your urine is clear, it is  very important to be  evaluated.

                The most common causes of blood in the urine—kidney stones and a bladder or prostate infection—are usually accompanied by many additional symptoms. The agonizing pain of kidney stones or the burning discomfort and urinary frequency of a bladder or prostate infection will usually get people to the doctor early. But when blood appears in your urine without accompanying pain, especially if there is only a single episode, you may take a “wait and see” attitude. This attitude may have dire consequences.

                If you see blood in your urine, tell your doctor as soon as possible. There are many causes of bleeding into the urinary tract, and one of them is cancer—which may be in the kidney, the ureter, the bladder, or the prostate. When they are still small enough to be curable, these cancers may not even cause pain. Blood in the urine may be the <i>only</i> clue for an early diagnosis.

                Other causes of blood in the urine include infections, kidney stones, kidney disease (nephritis), an enlarged prostate, certain medications, trauma, and exercise (especially biking and jogging).
