            Three red light warnign signals may indicate a tumor in the back of the eye are:
            <ul>
<li>"Unparallel" eyes--one eye looks straight ahead and the other looks in a different direction (this may be normal for infants under four months of age, but you should still consult your pediatrician)</li>
<li>One pupil appears white or consistently different from the other pupil</li>
<li>There is a change in the color of one iris.</li>
</ul>

                If your child has any of these signs, it is important to have him or her assessed by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist).

                Tumors of the retina (in the back of the eye) usually occur in the first two years of life and are more common in children with a family history of this condition. There is usually no pain associated with this type of tumor, which is known as a retinoblastoma.
            </p>

                Over 90 percent of children can be cured when there is an early diagnosis; rapid diagnosis and treatment increase the chances of preserving sight in the affected eye and saving the childâ€™s life. Genetic evaluation of the child and family is advised, because some of these cases are hereditary.
