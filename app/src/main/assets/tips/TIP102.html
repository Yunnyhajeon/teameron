            Mild tenderness over the liver (the right upper area of the belly, just under the ribs), swelling of the ankles and/or belly, and yellow jaundice may be signs of hepatitis. Drinking alcoholic beverages to excess, and/or over a long period of time, can cause or worsen liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and death.

                Drinking alcoholic beverages (whether liquor, beer, or wine) may cause injury to the liver. When an alcoholic beverage is consumed, the alcohol is rapidly absorbed through the stomach and small intestinal wall into the bloodstream. The breakdown of alcohol occurs mainly in the liver, where certain byproducts cause alcoholic hepatitis, or inflammation in the liver cells. These cells may be destroyed and replaced with scars. The condition of a scarred liver is called cirrhosis. When enough liver cells are destroyed, liver failure and death follow.

                The onset of liver cell inflammation from alcohol can be subtle, producing few symptoms. Instead of severe liver pain, you may feel mild tenderness over the liver and occasional nausea. As the inflammation and scarring progress, swelling will develop, first in the ankles and legs. Subsequently there will be swelling in the belly as fluid accumulates there. Liver failure will cause yellow jaundice and dark, tea-colored urine from the backup of yellow bile, which is made in the liver. This condition is readily diagnosable by a physician during a physical examination, with a blood test that measures liver enzymes, radiological studies, and sometimes a liver biopsy.

                Liver inflammation is not a disease of “drunks.” You do not have to be a heavy drinker to develop this condition. You may say, “I don’t drink the hard stuff,” or “I limit my drinking to beer,” but this type of liver inflammation occurs in beer drinkers just as often as it does in liquor and wine drinkers. Alcoholic hepatitis, even when it is so severe that you turn yellow, can be reversed if you eliminate your alcoholic intake early enough and medical treatment is instituted. The consequence of restarting alcohol intake is often cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), causing liver failure and death. Cancer of the liver is also more common in patients with cirrhosis.

                Individuals with any type of non-alcohol-related hepatitis (especially hepatitis C) are very sensitive to alcohol intake. It may increase liver inflammation and hasten the progression of liver destruction, resulting in cirrhosis. If you have liver disease, or if you have ever had alcoholic liver disease, do not drink any alcoholic beverages. Your doctor can help you stop. If you have cirrhosis, also be sure to avoid Tylenol (acetaminophen) and any other over-the-counter medication containing acetaminophen or any herbal product without first talking to your doctor. Many other medicines can further damage a cirrhotic liver. Always check with your doctor and/or pharmacist to make certain that all your medications are safe to take.

                The symptoms of liver disease are red light warning signals that you need medical evaluation and treatment as soon as possible.
