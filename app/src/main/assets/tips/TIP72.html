            A cough, fever, and chest pains with or without other common cold symptoms are often indicators of pneumonia. Failure to improve after fortyeight hours of treatment for pneumonia is a strong indication of a more serious infection requiring immediate medical evaluation. Note: These symptoms are sometimes indicators of blood clots in the lungs (see Tips 62 to 64, 175, and 249).

                People often think pneumonia always follows a bad cold. That is, first you have the typical cold symptoms—congestion in the head and a sore throat—and then your symptoms spread to the chest, accompanied by coughing. Not so. The first symptoms may be the sudden onset of a cough, fever, and chest pains, with no cold symptoms whatsoever. If this occurs, you should see your doctor right away.

                Once you start treatment for pneumonia, your condition should improve within forty-eight hours. If it does not, touch base with your doctor again. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, since this may indicate that the therapy is ineffective at this point and that the infection in your lungs has reached a very serious stage. If you have had your spleen removed, pneumonia can very quickly become fatal.

                Pneumonia is often caused by the bacterium pneumococcus. Alcoholics, smokers, senior citizens, and frail or disabled persons are particularly susceptible to this strain of pneumonia. While the vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia may prevent the disease or help the body’s defenses fight it, many other germs can also cause pneumonia, including staphylococcus, mycoplasma, and hemophilus.

                These symptoms could also be caused by a rare condition called Legionnaires’ disease, which is difficult to culture and identify. The illness often starts with diarrhea and possibly other flu-like symptoms. Then it goes on to involve the lungs. When this occurs you may have severe shortness of breath, fever, and a cough in which you bring up no phlegm (or only a small amount). This condition can be fatal if left untreated. The secret to survival is early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment. The disease is named Legionnaires’ disease because it was first discovered at an American Legion conference. Several members of the American Legion contracted the disease because the germ had contaminated the conference room’s air-conditioning system.

                If the cough, fever, and chest pain are diagnosed as being due to blood clots in the lung, your doctor will start you on blood thinners and other therapies immediately. This treatment can be life-saving.
