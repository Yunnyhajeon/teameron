            Diabetes is a condition caused by abnormally high blood sugar. You usually get it when you have low levels of or an immunity to insulin, a hormone that is produced in the pancreas. The earliest signs of diabetes include frequent urination and unquenchable thirst. Diabetics also often lose weight rapidly (within days or weeks).

                Insulin drives sugar from the blood into your body’s cells so they can get nourishment. In untreated diabetes the body no longer burns sugar as its normal source of energy and instead burns fat. When this happens, acid compounds are produced as by-products, causing the blood to become acidic. Some of this acid is eliminated through the lungs, producing the characteristic fruity-smelling breath. When the acid by-products build up and the blood sugar rises, you may also experience extreme thirst, shortness of breath, and/or abdominal pain. Without treatment, coma and death may follow.

                The diabetic rarely detects this strange-smelling breath odor. It is important that he or she is informed when it appears, since emergency medical evaluation is needed. Though most people have not smelled this odor before, it can be readily identified as an unusual smell. Unfortunately, since the acid in the person’s blood can make them act like they are intoxicated, the smell may be mistaken for alcohol, causing the person to be misdiagnosed. (See Appendix C for information about diabetes screening.)
