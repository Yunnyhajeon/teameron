                Many doctors recommend that you perform a selfexamination on your breasts in the same way at least once a month. The best time to perform a breast self-exam is about seven to ten days after your period, when your breasts are not swollen and tender. After menopause, check your breasts on the first day of every month. Regular self-examinations will familiarize you with what your breasts feel like normally so that you will be able to detect any changes. <b>However, it is important to remember that this should not take the place of a mammogram, which can pick up curable breast masses you canâ€™t feel.</b> Ask your doctor to review your self-exam technique when you go in for a routine health exam. The early detection and treatment of cancer increases the chance of a cure.

            <p>              
                The following are the current guidelines for examining your breasts:
                <ul>
                                <li>Lie down flat on your back with a pillow under your right shoulder.</li>
                                <li>Place your right arm behind your head (see Figure 18).</li>
                                <li>Press the pads of the three middle fingers of your left hand firmly on your right breast. (A ridge in the lower curve of each breast is normal.)</li>
                            </ul>
            </p>
