            If you suddenly get short of breath after injuring your leg, you may have a blood clot in your lung. You
            need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.

                A blow to your leg can damage the wall of a vein and cause the blood in that vein to clot. The swelling
                from the injury can also cause this problem, because it may slow blood flow in the vein such that clots
                form. Pieces of the clot can flow up the bloodstream to the lung. You are in need of emergency therapy
                to dissolve the clot or remove it. Immediate treatment can save your life. (See Tips 63, 64, 81, 175,
                and 249.)

                Note: Sometimes the swelling in your leg is not noticeable or it is hidden because your leg is in a
                cast.
