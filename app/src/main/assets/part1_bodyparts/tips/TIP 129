            A rare abnormal opening between the bladder and colon or other organs can cause you to pass bubbles while you urinate. This can make it seem as if you have a sputtering urine stream, as if your urine is being fired out of a machine gun. This condition can be caused by scarring or cancer. It may lead to serious infections. There are  other causes of bubbles appearing in the urine, although in these cases, the urine appears foamy, like beer. It may be a side effect of a medication, or the result of a forceful urine stream or increased protein in the urine (proteinuria). Proteinuria can be found in people with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and kidney disease.
