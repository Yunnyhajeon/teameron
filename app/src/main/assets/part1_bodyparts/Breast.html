            Any lump in the breast should be examined by a physician as soon as possible. If breast cancer is found and treated early, you have a greater chance for a cure.

                Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Many lumps are harmless growths or are tiny balloon-like structures containing fluid, called cysts. But any breast change should be evaluated without delay by a doctor to rule out cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though the mammogram (a special X-ray of the breast) is the best screening test to detect breast cancer, you can have a negative mammogram and still have breast cancer. Therefore your doctor should examine you first to try to locate a lump before ordering a mammogram. Alternatively, your doctor may choose to order a diagnostic test called an ultrasound, which uses special sound waves to take a picture of the lump. He or she may also insert a small needle to draw out any fluid or cells from the lump. For most women, examination of a piece of the lump (biopsy) under a microscope is the best way to make a definitive diagnosis of what is causing the abnormal growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Risk factors for breast cancer include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a previous history of breast cancer</li>
                    <li>a family history of breast cancer (if your mother or sisters have had breast cancer, you are at a two to three times greater risk)</li>
                    <li>increasing age (85 percent of breast cancers occur after the age of 40 and half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65). Note: Younger women can also get breast cancer.</li>
                    <li>exposure to radiation</li>
                    <li>not having children</li>
                    <li>pregnancy at a late age (usually after 30)</li>
                    <li>early menstruation (before the age of 12)</li>
                    <li>going through menopause at a later age than normal (usually after 55)</li>
                    <li>long-term use of hormone replacement therapy with progesterone as a component</li>
                    <li>genetic predisposition (certain mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes)</li>
                    <li>the use of oral contraceptives</li>
                    <li>the regular consumption of alcohol</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>However, it’s important to remember that the number 1 risk factor for breast cancer is being a woman.</i> All women need to be conscientious about taking measures for early detection.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key to beating breast cancer is early detection. Knowing what is normal for you may help you identify a lump, so many physicians feel that monthly breast self-exams are valuable. However, they should not take the place of routine breast exams by a physician and regular mammograms. A mammogram is the best test to pick up early breast cancer in the general population. (See Appendix B, page 364, for how to perform a breast self-exam and Appendix C, page 372, for information on breast cancer screening.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Contact your doctor immediately if you detect a lump in your breast. Only one percent of all breast cancers occur in men, but any man with a breast lump should also be examined by a physician.

            Changes in a breast, including redness and/or swelling, dimpling of the skin, orange-peel appearance of the skin, nipple retraction, or crusty appearance of the nipple may indicate cancer even if you cannot feel a mass. A thorough medical evaluation is necessary as soon as possible.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you were born with retracted nipples—nipples that do not project outward—you may have more difficulty nursing babies. Otherwise, you should have no problems related to your nipples. However, retraction of a previously normal nipple may be caused by a growth located under the nipple, which could be cancerous.
            </p>

            <p>
                Deformities of the skin of the breast that cause redness or swelling, dimpling, an orange-peel appearance, and/or a crusty appearance of the nipples indicate a progressive disease in the breast that may be cancer. These changes can be subtle, often occurring without pain. They are red light warning signals calling for immediate medical evaluation.

            There are many types of fluids that can drain abnormally from your nipple. The following are the three main types: bloody discharge, white milky fluid, and green fluid. The type of fluid is indicative of the underlying breast problem. Clear fluids should also be evaluated by your physician because they are occasionally a sign of breast cancer.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                <b>Bloody discharge.</b> A bloody discharge from the nipple that is sometimes watery and foul-smelling could be a serious matter. Most often, it originates from a localized growth (intraductal papilloma) in the lining of the tiny tube leading to the nipple of the breast. These tiny growths are so small that they cannot be felt by examining the breast. Although uncommon, intraductal cancer must be considered. A mammogram, biopsy, and/or surgical exploration of the nipple duct may be needed to rule out cancer. See your doctor as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>White milky fluid.</b> A milky white substance leaking from one or both of your nipples is called galactorrhea. Gently milk your nipple to see if you can draw out the fluid. Note the color, amount, and consistency. The fluid of galactorrhea has the consistency of water. The amount is usually small and is similar to the fluid secreted during pregnancy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pituitary gland, which is attached to the undersurface of the brain, secretes prolactin, the hormone responsible for lactation. Certain benign (noncancerous) tumors of this gland over-secrete the substance, causing the breast to leak this white watery discharge. Other signs that this might be occurring include the absence or alteration of your menstrual periods and problems with your peripheral vision (such as experiencing narrowed vision, like a horse wearing blinders). Tumors of this type are benign, but if untreated they can cause damage to surrounding brain structures, like the nerves to the eye.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other possible causes for nipple discharge include certain medications, foreplay with the nipples, jogging without proper breast support, or various ailments including hypothyroidism (a low-functioning thyroid gland) or shingles (a painful rash caused by a virus). See your doctor for appropriate evaluation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Green fluid.</b> A green-colored, watery fluid coming from the nipple of one or both breasts is fairly common and usually benign, although it may persist. It often comes from small fluidfilled pockets in the breast, which are caused by hormones. The fluid is usually first noticed when you discover a stain on your bra. You can make sure it is coming from the nipple by compressing your breast. If a drop of fluid appears on the nipple’s surface, dab it with a tissue to note the color. Your breasts may also be tender; this discharge usually occurs around the time of menstruation, which is the time of maximum breast engorgement. See your doctor for evaluation.

            Male breast enlargement commonly occurs in adolescents, obese persons, or alcohol drinkers. It can be caused by a hormonal imbalance or certain medications, but on rare occasions may be a sign of cancer in the testicles or lungs or another serious ailment. It may or may not be associated with pain.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you are an adult male and have noted an enlargement of your breasts, you may have a condition known as gynecomastia, which causes the breast tissue to get solid and lumpy, as opposed to the normal fat tissue near the nipples.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some breast enlargement may be normal, resulting from the higher levels of the hormone estrogen found in young developing boys or the decreased levels of testosterone found in some elderly men (usually due to shrunken testicles). Since the hormone testosterone counteracts the effects of estrogen, normal adult men have very little breast tissue under their nipples.
            </p>

            <p>
                The most common cause of abnormal breast enlargement is a side effect of medications, including diuretics, Digoxin, Dilantin, the tuberculosis drug INH, spironolactone, methadone, anticancer drugs, some antihypertensive drugs, Nizoral, Tagamet, theophylline, Zantac, and Flagyl. These drugs can upset the balance of testosterone and estrogen. If possible, you and your doctor may decide to alter your medications. The abuse of anabolic steroids, alcohol, and marijuana has also been reported to cause breast enlargement. Though rare, it can also be caused by Klinefelter’s syndrome, a congenital condition that afflicts one in every five hundred men. It can lead to enlarged breast tissue and small testicles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Less common causes of male breast enlargement include chronic liver disease, kidney disease, breast cancer, hypothyroidism, a pituitary gland tumor, and hormone-secreting tumors in organs such as the lungs and testicles. It is important that you seek medical evaluation to determine if you have any of these underlying ailments so that early treatment can be instituted. Occasionally, no cause is found for the breast enlargement.
