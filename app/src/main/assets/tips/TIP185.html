            Your thyroid gland does not have to be enlarged in order to be overactive or underactive. The vari- ety of symptoms accompanying an overactive or underactive thyroid gland require early diagnosis and treatment to prevent serious complications.
            The red light warning signals of an overactive thyroid are: intolerance to heat, a rapid and irregular pulse, tremors, fatigue, profuse sweating, in- creased appetite, a feeling of anxiety, and/or bulging eyes.
            The red light warning signals of an underac- tive thyroid are: cold intolerance, feeling cold all of the time, loss of memory, generalized body swelling (especially of the face), irregular and slow pulse, and/or a high cholesterol level.

                The thyroid gland is located in the center of the base of the neck (see Figure 14). It serves as the body’s thermostat, regulating the metabolic functions—that is to say, how quickly or slowly you burn up calories. An overactive thyroid promotes a rapid metabolic rate, while an underactive one slows it down.
            </p>
<p>
                The size of your thyroid gland has nothing to do with whether it is overactive or underactive. If the gland has not changed in size but is functioning abnormally, you may not know to seek treatment since the symptoms may have developed gradually.
            </p>
<p>
                An overactive thyroid gland, producing excess thyroid hormone, causes the symptoms listed above, and may even cause heart failure.
            </p>
<p>
                An underactive thyroid produces an insufficient amount of thyroid hormone. Besides the general symptoms listed above, you may experience marked weakness, confusion, and/or paleness or a yellowish appearance.
            </p>
<p>
                Both conditions are frequently associated with fatigue and double vision. An overactive thyroid can cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities, while an underactive thyroid can result in a high cholesterol level. These and many other complications are a good reason to seek medical care as soon as possible when the symptoms creep up on you.
