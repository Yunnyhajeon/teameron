            Difficulty breathing and a wheezing sound while breathing, often following physical exertion, are signs of an asthma attack. Left untreated, an asthma attack can lead to severe chest muscle fatigue and death.

                How do you know when an asthma attack is life-threatening? The most important consideration is how long it lasts. Since asthma makes breathing difficult, it requires much more energy to draw each breath, leading to fatigue. As the attack goes on, you will become increasingly tired, and your condition will thus become more life-threatening. During an attack, as the muscles for breathing become tired, the volume of air exchanged by the lungs will decrease. This decrease may be so subtle that you will hardly notice it. The result will be a drop in the oxygen level, accompanied by a rise in the carbon dioxide level in the blood.
            </p>
<p>
                Carbon dioxide is a by-product of body metabolism; it is carried by the bloodstream to the lungs, where it is exhaled out of the body. If the lungs cannot get rid of carbon dioxide, it will build up in your blood. A carbon dioxide buildup in the blood has a sedating effect on the brain, which may cause you to feel even drowsier. You may lose the motivation or energy to breathe. 
            </p>

                In other words, if an asthma attack proceeds without proper treatment, you can get worse without realizing it. As your breathing worsens, your ability to think rationally also decreases and your brain will not recognize how ill you are becoming. This may result in you not being able to call for help. When respiratory failure develops, your condition may deteriorate rapidly. Death from respiratory arrest (cessation of breathing) can occur unexpectedly.
            </p>

                Urgent medical attention is necessary for a first-time asthma attack. It is also appropriate when an attack continues, does not improve, or gets worse. Signs that asthma is worsening include the need to use higher doses of inhalants, frequent episodes of shortness of breath (more than two to three times per week), or decreasing peak flow measurements when using a special monitor device (which you can get from your doctor).

                If you suffer from asthma, you need to have an emergency medical plan. For example, you need to know where to go for emergency medical care, and you need a contingency plan for how you can keep your emergency medicines available to you at all times (no matter where you are). Note: Adult-onset asthma (especially in obese persons) may be caused by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus.
