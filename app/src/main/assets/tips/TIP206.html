            Chronic or persistent hoarseness, often with difficulty breathing, may be caused by papilloma (viral induced growths) on the vocal chords. Chronic hoarseness and/or pain when swallowing may be the first signs of gastric reflux. A child with any of these symptoms should be evaluated. If the growths (warts) become large, they can obstruct breathing. Also they can progress farther down the airway and become impossible to treat.

<p>
                Children are often hoarse for a short period of time after a coldâ€”or too much shouting! However, if your child (especially a child under five) is hoarse repeatedly or has hoarseness that persists for about a month or more, he/she may need assessment by a pediatric ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor who will look in the throat with a scope. Then the doctor will institute proper treatment.

                Note: There is a vaccine that may have value in preventing the growth of these papillomas. (See Appendix C, about the HPV vaccine, Pap smear, and pelvic exam.)
