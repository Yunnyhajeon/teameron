            If you have the symptoms of nausea (possibly with vomiting), headache, and fatigue, consider that you may have carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if you feel worse indoors and someone you live with is experiencing similar symptoms. Other possible symptoms include bright red gums and lips, cherry red skin, weakness, mental confusion, dilated pupils, and/or chest pain (particularly if you are elderly). It is crucial to evacuate the house or the car and seek medical treatment.

                Poisoning from carbon monoxide inhalation is a leading cause of accidental death, despite public awareness of its dangers. It can occur very subtly because the gas is odorless and colorless, and there is no way of knowing that it is present until illness occurs. It does not take a lot of exposure to make you very sick—children will usually be affected first, but carbon monoxide poisoning can kill both adults and children quickly. Note: If you have pets, they will also become sick from excess exposure to the gas.

                The best way you can protect yourself against carbon monoxide poisoning is to be aware. Have a heat and air company test the air inside your home for carbon monoxide, and test the heating system for proper exhaust once a year. Do not use kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, or camp stoves without proper ventilation, and make sure not to leave your car running in an enclosed area. If you have any of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning while in your car, get the exhaust system checked and make sure there are no holes in the floorboard. If you have a boat with a motor, have the engine and exhaust system checked regularly. This is important, because dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can accumulate on a boat even when it’s docked at a pier, by a stone wall, or alongside another boat. Also, make sure that no one ever swims near the boat while the motor is running. Inexpensive carbon monoxide monitors, which are sold at most hardware or department stores, will sound an alarm when levels of carbon monoxide get too high. Consider installing one on each level of your home or boat.

                If you suspect that you are being exposed to high levels of CO, you can have your blood tested by a doctor for the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, which can confirm a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. Note: This test may be inaccurate if you are a smoker, as levels of carboxyhemoglobin can be altered by exposure to tobacco smoke. Also, the level of carboxyhemoglobin will be lower if you have been away from the carbon monoxide for a lengthy period of time.

                If you develop any of the red light warning signals of carbon monoxide poisoning, get out of the enclosed area and into fresh air immediately. Go to an emergency room for evaluation and treatment.
