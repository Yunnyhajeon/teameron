            A lump found in the thyroid gland, at the front base of the neck (under the “Adam’s apple” in men), may be cancerous.

                If you detect an enlargement or lump at the front base of your neck, make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible for testing and treatment. When your thyroid gland is larger than normal, you have a goiter. The three basic kinds of enlargement are:
                <ul>
                    <li>A general enlargement of the entire gland, often caused by a disorder of the immune system. It can also be caused by a deficiency of iodine (which is rare).</li>
                    <li>A lumpy enlargement of the entire gland, which is usually harmless but may eventually lead to decreased gland function. Cancer is occasionally found in part of the gland.</li>
                    <li>A single lump in the gland, which may be cancerous. Thyroid cancer can often be cured with treatment.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Any abnormality in the thyroid gland needs to be evaluated by a physician. (Also see Appendix C, page 371, for information about thyroid screening.)

            A lump anywhere in the neck can be a sign of a serious illness.

            <p>
                The most serious neck lumps are often not associated with thyroid disease (in the front base of the neck). These lumps are only found on one side of your neck and are usually indicative of a lymph node that has become enlarged due to an infection. If the lump is located toward the front of your neck, it is probably the result of a throat infection. If it is in the back, it is probably the result of a scalp or ear infection. These enlarged lymph nodes are often less than an inch thick, and have a rubbery, semi-soft feel. They should shrink within fourteen days of treatment of the infection. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Lumps in the neck that are present for longer than fourteen days, are over one inch in size, are firm or hard in texture, and/or are not tender are more suspicious and may signify cancer of the lymph nodes or cancer that has spread from another site.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are the general guidelines for examining lymph nodes, but there are exceptions. Seek advice from your doctor if any such lump persists.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            Gradually increasing pain in the back of the neck or lower back over a period of several days, often accompanied by night sweats and a low-grade fever, may be caused by a serious infection. The pain may extend from the neck into an arm or  from the lower back into a leg, followed by sudden weakness in that arm or leg. This requires emergency evaluation. You may have an epidural or intraspinal abscess. Seek medical care immediately.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                An epidural or intraspinal abscess is an infection that occurs within the confines of the spinal canal, a space surrounded by the bone of the vertebrae extending from the head to the tailbone. This space contains the spinal cord.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bacteria can enter the spinal canal via the bloodstream from a site elsewhere in the body, often the gums of the mouth or a skin infection. After gaining entrance to the spinal canal, the bacteria establish an infection in the wall of the canal. The body defenses react by walling off the infection and forming an abscess. The abscess rises like a boil, putting pressure on the spinal cord. First an arm or leg becomes weak, and then additional pressure may lead to a loss of function of the spinal cord and paralysis of all muscles below the level of pressure. An abscess in the neck area can paralyze both arms and legs. If it is in the lower back, it can paralyze both legs. Early treatment is essential to avoid permanent paralysis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Take no chances. If you develop these symptoms, call 911 or have someone take you to an emergency room immediately.
