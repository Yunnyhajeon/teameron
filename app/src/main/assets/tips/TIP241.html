                        For over a century it was the custom to shave a body area prior to surgery at that site. A recent study found that this method of hair removal actually increases the incidence of wound infection. So what now?

                    The proper way to prepare a site for surgery is to clip the hair instead of shaving it. So, if someone comes at you with a razor, ask them to use clippers instead. This may seem like a small point, but it is important. One-hundred-year-old customs do not die easily.
