            The bite of an animal with rabies can be fatal. Therefore, if you are bitten by a dog, cat, raccoon, fox, skunk, horse, bat, or any other warm-blooded animal, you need immediate medical attention. Note: You can also get rabies from exposure to the saliva of a rabid animal (via contact with an open wound or your mucous membranes). For example, bats flying in the room of a sleeping person or near an awake, unattended child have been reported to have spread the disease to the individual, even when there has been no evidence of a bite.
