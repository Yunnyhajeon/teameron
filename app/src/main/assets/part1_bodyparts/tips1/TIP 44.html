            Gradually increasing pain in the back of the neck or lower back over a period of several days, often accompanied by night sweats and a low-grade fever, may be caused by a serious infection. The pain may extend from the neck into an arm or  from the lower back into a leg, followed by sudden weakness in that arm or leg. This requires emergency evaluation. You may have an epidural or intraspinal abscess. Seek medical care immediately.
