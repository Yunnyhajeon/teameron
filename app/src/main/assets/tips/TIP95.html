            An ulcer in the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine, just below the stomach) often causes pain in the upper-middle area of the belly, with or without bloody vomit and black tarry stools. It may wake you from sleep.

<p>
                An ulcer is a sore on the lining of the stomach or duodenum. It can cause pain if it penetrates the wall or causes a spasm. (Some ulcers are painless.)
            </p>
<p>
                Inside the stomach the chemical hydrochloric acid and associated enzymes can change a piece of meat (or any food) from solid to liquid. The stomach and duodenum contain a mucous coating that covers the lining of their walls. This coating prevents the acid and enzymes from dissolving the stomach wall itself. Various substances—including nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, aspirin, some pain medicines such as ibuprofen (acetaminophen does not cause ulcers), and certain bacteria (see Tip 97)—diminish these defenses, causing ulcers to form. Also, people with hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism occasionally develop ulcers. (See Tip 187 for more about parathyroid conditions.) Note: Taking blood-thinning products, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and warfarin (Coumadin), while you are taking aspirin increases the chance that you will bleed internally, particularly if you have an existing ulcer.

                Bleeding into the duodenum may result in black tarry stools that are very sticky. Vomiting is also associated with the irritation caused by ulcers. Early medical treatment is necessary to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences, such as bleeding and perforation.
