                Pneumonia and flu can be contracted from other patients while you are in the hospital. This is particularly dangerous (and there is a higher risk of a resulting fatality) if you are   elderly.

                    Reduce the risk of developing pneumonia and influenza. Particularly if you are elderly, make sure that you are up-to-date on all your vaccinations, and that you are not placed in a room with anyone who is infectious. Many doctors recommend that hospitalized patients take a few deep breaths and cough to clear their airway every hour or so. Some doctors even prescribe the use of a spirometer to facilitate deep breathing. It is felt that these measures decrease the risk of developing infections in the lungs. (See Tip 72 for more on pneumonia.)

                    Note: It may be helpful to remind yourself to breathe deeply at set times, for example during commercial breaks if you are watching TV.
