            If you are pregnant and have any of the following symptoms, seek immediate medical care:
            <ul>
<li>Severe belly pain</li>
<li>Leaking or breaking water</li>
<li>Decreased or absent fetal movements</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="body_contents">
<p>
            There are many potential causes of these symptoms. The more serious ones may put you and your unborn baby at serious health risks.
            </p>
                An emergency medical evaluation is needed for:
                <ul>
<li><b>Severe belly pressure or pain.</b> In some of the most serious cases, this type of pain can be associated with internal bleeding in the uterus or rupture of the uterus at the site of the scar of a previous cesarean section. Other causes may include (depending on gestational age) tubal pregnancy, miscarriage, preterm labor, or infections.</li>
<li><b>Premature leaking or breaking of your water.</b> This can cause a serious infection in both you and the fetus. Also, in certain circumstances your water breaking early may compromise the blood and oxygen supply (via the umbilical cord) to the fetus.</li>
<li><b>Absence of fetal movement. </b> If you do not feel the fetus move or you feel a substantial change or decrease in fetal movement, you must be evaluated immediately by your ob/gyn</li>
</ul>
