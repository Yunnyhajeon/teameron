            Paralysis of the arms or legs, weakness (especially on one side of the face or body), tingling, burning pain, numbness, confusion, dizziness, double vision, slurred speech, trouble finding words, speaking “gibberish,” etc., could be signs of a stroke, and you should get to an appropriate emergency center immediately. Early treatment may prevent permanent damage to the brain or even save your life.

                A stroke may be caused by a blood clot that has formed in one of the arteries that supplies the brain with oxygen (see Figure 3). It can also be caused by a blood clot that has formed in a vessel somewhere else in the body, including the heart, and has traveled through the blood to a vessel in the brain. The area supplied by the blocked blood vessel will be rapidly damaged. The loss of oxygen affects the brain before any other body organ, and a few minutes of oxygen deprivation can result in the permanent loss of function.

                The symptoms of a stroke depend on which particular area of the brain is involved. If a large vessel is blocked, such as the middle cerebral artery, a large area of the brain will be affected, causing paralysis of one side of the body as well as the loss of other functions such as understanding and speaking. If a smaller blood vessel is blocked, paralysis may be limited to one arm or leg.

                The right side of the body is controlled by the left side of the brain, and vice versa. The left side of the brain is typically dominant for comprehension and verbalization. If you have a large stroke on the left side of your brain, it may make you unable to comprehend or to speak (for example, you know what you want to say but are unable to express your thoughts in words) and it will paralyze the right side of your body. If the stroke is on the other side, you will be paralyzed on the left side of your body and it will usually not affect your ability to comprehend or speak.

                A stroke can also result from the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, which subsequently can hemorrhage. Cigarette smoking, uncontrolled high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and uncontrolled diabetes all increase your risk of having a stroke.

                A stroke treatment that immediately dissolves blood clots in the brain is available at many emergency centers. If instituted soon enough, this treatment can potentially stop a stroke before permanent brain injury has occurred. At present, the commonly available clot-buster therapy needs to be given within three hours of the onset of symptoms in order for it to work, though newer medications that are being developed may work for longer after symptoms first appear. Also, at some hospitals, a catheter can sometimes be put into a clogged artery to mechanically destroy the clot or to inject medicine near the clot, thus dissolving it. There are reports that the symptoms of a stroke have been reversed six hours from onset with this specific type of treatment. This therapy is not appropriate for all stroke victims. For example, if the stroke is the result of a hemorrhage in the brain, clot-buster therapy or a blood thinner could actually worsen your condition.

                Call an ambulance and get immediate transportation to an appropriate emergency room where clot-busting therapy is available. Hospitals will often make known that they are certified stroke centers. All stroke victims need urgent evaluation even if they are not able to get to medical care in the first three hours. Do not wait! Time is of the essence to save your brain.
