            Fatigue, dizziness, and/or headache are the first symptoms of heat exhaustion and they may progress to a life-threatening case of heatstroke if you do not respond appropriately. Working or playing in the hot sun can be dangerous, as can a lack of proper ventilation and air-conditioning in the summertime (particularly for the elderly). Anyone who appears to act confused after being in a hot environment needs to be cooled down and taken to the ER immediately.

                It is hard to tell when you are in danger of heat exhaustion. When you are active on a hot day, the body uses its cooling mechanism to release sweat, because the evaporation of sweat on the body’s surface allows it to shed heat. The body is generally able to keep an even temperature this way, but environmental factors like high humidity and the absence of a breeze can make it difficult for the body to cool itself. Also, individuals with fewer sweat glands are in greater danger of heat exhaustion, as are senior citizens and young children, who have less effective cooling mechanisms.
            </p>

                Fluid loss and a rise in body temperature can result in a serious derangement of body chemistry. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include any combination of the following:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Nausea</li>
<li>Dizziness and/or headache</li>
<li>Weakness, fatigue</li>
<li>Paleness</li>
<li>Incoordination and/or confusion</li>
<li>Muscle cramps</li>
<li>Vomiting</li>
<li>Low or no urine output</li>
<li>Pounding heartbeat</li>
<li>Fainting</li>
</ul>
<p>
                If you have any of the above symptoms, it is urgent that you do the following in order to avoid heatstroke:
             </p>
<ul>
<li>Rest.</li>
<li>Move to the shade or indoors with air-conditioning. Sit in front of a fan.</li>
<li>Place a wet towel over your face, arms, and legs.</li>
<li>Spray yourself with cool water.</li>
<li>Drink cool, nonalcoholic beverages, such as apple juice or Gatorade, to replace your electrolytes. Note: Eating a banana may help replace potassium in the body if you don’t have access to Gatorade.</li>
<li>Seek medical assistance, especially if your symptoms include a feeling of confusion. Call 911 or get somebody to take you to the ER immediately. You may need to be given intravenous fluids or other therapy in order to cool down quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
                The most effective method of handling heat exhaustion is to prevent it. Take frequent breaks from exercise and exposure to heat. If you get tired, rest and cool off for a while.
