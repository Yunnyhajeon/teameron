            The best method to control blood spurting from a blood vessel due to a severe laceration is to put direct pressure on the wound and pressure on another blood vessel between the wound and the heart. Some examples of good secondary pressure points are between the shoulder and elbow, the groin area, and behind the knee. This approach is better than using a tourniquet. Also, elevate the wound area above the heart if possible.

                Very few things are more frightening than seeing blood spurting from a severed artery after a serious injury. The best way to reduce bleeding is to apply direct pressure. Gauze dressing is the ideal material to press against the wound, but if gauze is unavailable, any type of cloth will suffice. Continued compression will cause the artery to constrict, and clotting will follow. Even bleeding from a large artery can be controlled in this fashion until emergency care arrives.
            </p>
<p>
                Do not attempt to wash the wound or remove any debris. If there is anything sticking out of the wound, wrap material and apply direct pressure around it. If it is a head injury, do not apply direct pressure, since there may be a skull fracture that can be made worse. Wrap material snugly around the head to cover the wound.
            </p>
<p>
                Avoid the temptation to look under the bandage to see if the bleeding has stopped; you may break the clot and make the bleeding worse. Once direct pressure has been applied, leave the gauze in place until it is removed by a health professional. If it bleeds through, apply another cloth on top of the first one.
            </p>

                If too much blood is lost, an individual may go into shock (this condition is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, cold/clammy skin, paleness, etc.). If this happens:
             </p>
<ul>
<li>Call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
<li>Lay the victim on his/her back and elevate the legs. However, if you suspect a neck injury, DO NOT move the victim.</li>
<li>If he/she stops breathing, begin CPR (see Appendix A, for CPR guidelines).</li>
<li>Keep the victim warm.</li>
</ul>
<p>
                If you are assisting an injured person, avoid contaminating your eyes, mouth, or an open wound with their blood. Wear gloves when available and wash yourself well for fifteen minutes as soon as possible.
