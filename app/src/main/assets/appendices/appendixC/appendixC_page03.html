                <p>
A timely diagnosis of thyroid cancer is very important, since it can be cured if detected early. The screening for thyroid cancer involves clinical evaluation by a doctor, who observes and feels the thyroid gland for abnormalities. This is done at the time of a routine physical examination. If irregularities are found, an ultrasound may be requested to further define abnormalities. Various conditions in a person’s history may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, including excess exposure to X-rays. Diagnosing other thyroid diseases such as goiter (an enlarged thyroid), hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), and hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid) may require blood tests and/or biopsies.
</p>
<p>
The risk of hypothyroidism increases with age. The American Thyroid Association recommends that all women over thirty-five years of age should be screened for hypothyroidism every five years. Also, women who are pregnant or planning to get pregnant should get tested; a mother’s thyroid problems can affect the fetus.

            <p>
The key to beating breast cancer is early detection. Knowing what is normal for you may help you identify a lump, so many physicians feel that monthly breast self-exams are valuable. <b><i>However, they should not take the place of mammography so that very small curable cancers are not missed.</i></b> Routine breast exams by a physician are also important. Contact your doctor immediately if you detect a lump in your breast.
            </p>

            <p>The following are guidelines for early detection:</p>
            <p><ul><li>Every woman should know what her breasts normally feel like, and report any breast changes promptly to her physician. Starting in their twenties, women may choose to perform breast self-exams. (See Appendix B, for instruction on how to perform a breast self-exam.)</li></ul></p>
