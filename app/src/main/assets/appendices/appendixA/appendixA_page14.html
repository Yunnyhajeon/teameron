        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING COMES DIRECTLY AFTER THE SECTION TITLE
        Example: HEAD section title is directly followed by HEADACHE subsection in the book, aka 
                 headache is the first subsection of the section

        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING IS THE FIRST SUBSECTION OF THE SECTION

               The AED will make one of two decisions once it is attached: </p>
               <p>
                <b>Shock advised:</b> In this case, stand clear to allow the machine to provide a shock. Once the shock is provided, the machine will prompt when it is safe to touch the victim. Do not turn off the machine or remove the pads. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. If there’s no breath, open the airway (by lifting the chin and tilting the head back) and proceed with two minutes of CPR (5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). Always begin with compressions.
                </p>

                <p>
                After two minutes, the AED will analyze and decide again whether it should shock or not. Usually when an AED is used, a normal heartbeat may restart after the first or second shock, but sometimes more shocks may be required.
                </p>
                <p>
                The AED will continue cycling through analyzing, shocking—if needed—and then allowing two minutes to provide CPR. Continue to follow the prompts until emergency medical professionals arrive.
                </p>

                When you are alone with a person who stops breathing and they are in need of CPR and an AED, there are a few things to consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adult: Immediately CALL 911 and get the AED if it is readily available. Give 2 initial rescue breaths, then begin to provide CPR (alternating between 30 compressions: 2 breaths) and use the AED.  *Remember: The chance of survival decreases by 10 percent for every minute you delay starting CPR.</li>
                        <li>Child: Immediately give 2 initial rescue breaths, then begin CPR. Provide TWO MINUTES of CPR (about 5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). If the child is not responding to the CPR, call 911 and get the AED (if readily available).</li>
                        <li>Then continue CPR, and use the AED.  *Remember: The chance of survival decreases the longer there is a lapse in giving CPR.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
