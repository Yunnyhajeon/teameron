            Diabetes is a condition caused by abnormally high blood sugar. You usually get it when you have low levels of or an immunity to insulin, a hormone that is produced in the pancreas. The earliest signs of diabetes include frequent urination and unquenchable thirst. Diabetics also often lose weight rapidly (within days or weeks).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Insulin drives sugar from the blood into your body’s cells so they can get nourishment. In untreated diabetes the body no longer burns sugar as its normal source of energy and instead burns fat. When this happens, acid compounds are produced as by-products, causing the blood to become acidic. Some of this acid is eliminated through the lungs, producing the characteristic fruity-smelling breath. When the acid by-products build up and the blood sugar rises, you may also experience extreme thirst, shortness of breath, and/or abdominal pain. Without treatment, coma and death may follow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The diabetic rarely detects this strange-smelling breath odor. It is important that he or she is informed when it appears, since emergency medical evaluation is needed. Though most people have not smelled this odor before, it can be readily identified as an unusual smell. Unfortunately, since the acid in the person’s blood can make them act like they are intoxicated, the smell may be mistaken for alcohol, causing the person to be misdiagnosed. (See Appendix C for information about diabetes screening.)

            A metallic taste on the tongue or a garlic odor on the breath may indicate arsenic poisoning.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The early signs of arsenic poisoning are sometimes a garlic odor on the breath and a metallic taste on the tongue. Later symptoms include vomiting and a burning, upset stomach. You may also experience other symptoms, including a burning and tingling in your arms and legs (which results from the damage to your nerves). Note: The early symptoms of arsenic poisoning can also be caused by certain medications like Biaxin, which tend to give you an abnormal taste in your mouth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Arsenic poisoning has been known to occur in incidents of mail-order poisoning. No doubt you have also heard of food supplements or medications being intentionally laced with arsenic and distributed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Call your local poison control center or the national poison control number (1-800-222-1222) for additional information and advice on appropriate evaluation and treatment if you suspect that you have been exposed to arsenic.

            A sore inside of the mouth, on the tongue, or in the throat that does not heal may be cancer. White spots in these areas may also be an early sign of cancer.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A sore inside of the mouth, on the tongue, or in the throat that does not heal within three weeks is considered cancer until proven otherwise. Many of these early cancers first appear as red sores in the mouth (called erythroplasia). White spots (called leukoplakia), which can be found in the same locations, are also potentially precancerous. Though leukoplakia are more common, erythroplasia are more likely to become cancerous.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leukoplakia can result from the abrasive contact of the mouth’s lining with the rough edge of a tooth or denture, but are more commonly caused by the use of tobacco or alcohol. These substances are very irritating to surface cells in the mouth, and can lead to the formation of leukoplakia. If this overgrowth continues, it can evolve into cancer, which can then spread to other parts of the body. An ear, nose, and throat specialist or a dental surgeon is the best specialist to evaluate both types of sores. Make an appointment as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another cause of white spots in the mouth is a yeast infection. Yeast infections in the mouths of babies are common because babies have youthful immune systems. They can also occur in the mouths of adults with an abnormally weak immune system caused by diseases such as HIV infection. Additionally, yeast infections can appear as a side effect from taking antibiotics or steroids. For example, they can occur after the prolonged daily use of inhaled corticosteroid inhalers for asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or emphysema (Asthmacort, Advair, etc.). If they persist, these white spots warrant evaluation.

            A blue or black spot or a nonpigmented growth in the mouth may be a sign of mucosal melanoma, a rare type of cancer.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                At an early stage, mucosal melanoma can appear as a blue or black spot or a nonpigmented growth, usually on the roof of the mouth or on the gums around your front upper teeth. Other more common causes of a blue or black spot include stains from silver fillings.

            Chronically infected gums, known as periodontal disease, may cause serious illness or even death. Do not put off seeing your dentist.

        <div class="body_contents">

                Patients generally consider dental care only for cosmetic reasons, thinking it unessential for maintaining good health. It can be expensive, so it is often at the bottom of their priority list. Thousands of people go about their business not realizing that the poor state of their gums is risking the overall health of their body.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is a fact that everybody’s mouth houses bacteria (germs) that enter your bloodstream when your gums are manipulated. The body’s natural defenses can often kill these bacteria when they enter the bloodstream. However, the germs occasionally survive and can infect heart valves that have been infected in the past, or can damage artificial heart valves. In addition, the condition of having chronically infected gums (periodontal disease) may contribute to damage to the internal lining of your coronary arteries (small blood vessels supplying nourishment to the heart) such that it leads to a heart attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usually when you visit the dentist for some sort of procedure, you will be asked if you have a history of having an infected heart valve, have an artificial heart valve, etc. If you do, you are at increased risk, and may be given an antibiotic to prevent infecting your heart valve before starting dental treatment. However, recent studies indicate that people with chronically infected gums may continually be at a higher risk of a heart attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                The important message to the general public is to get regular checkups by the dentist so that gum disease can be properly diagnosed and treated. Routinely brush and floss your teeth. Ask your dentist or dental hygienist to show you how to properly use a toothbrush and dental floss. Make proper dental care a priority.
