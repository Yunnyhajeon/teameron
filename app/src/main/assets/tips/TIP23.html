            The sudden onset of seeing many spots before your eyes can be an urgent warning that you should seek medical
            evaluation.

                Seeing spots can be caused by a variety of medical problems. Some spots are normal, like seeing blood
                vessels when you are staring up at a blue sky or seeing spots for just a second when you stand up
                quickly. Some are essentially meaningless, like a floater that drifts across your vision and moves away
                when you try to focus on it. However, some are important and may precede a serious event such as
                blindness.

            <p>
                One such condition is an outpouching of the blood vessels of the retina (the back part of the eye where
                vision is recorded and transmitted to the brain), called retinal microaneurysm. In a more advanced eye
                disease, for example, one caused by diabetes, new abnormal blood vessels grow and are at risk of
                rupturing. If these vessels rupture, blood can flow inside the eye, causing the sudden and severe loss
                of vision.

                So, if you notice the onset of many spots in your field of vision, contact an ophthalmologist
                immediately. Since these symptoms may be associated with diabetes, diabetics should have their eyes
                checked every year to find and treat any abnormal growths of the blood vessels and prevent the
                complications that cause these symptoms.
