            If you have a severe sore throat with fever and a fiery red rash all over your body, seek medical evaluation right away. You may have scarlet fever. If this is the case, your tongue may also look like an intensely red strawberry, and your throat may turn red with white splotches.

<p>
                Scarlet fever is caused by a rare type of the same germ that gives you strep throat. The germ releases a toxic substance into the bloodstream, which causes the red rash (your skin may also peel off as though you have been sunburned). The release of this toxic substance can lead to heart and kidney disease, so antibiotic therapy is needed as soon as possible to avoid life-threatening complications. Note: This disease was much more common before the use of antibiotics.
