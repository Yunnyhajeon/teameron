            A nonpainful, raw-looking sore located on or near the penis, vaginal area, breast, or mouth may be an early sign of syphilis.

                Initially syphilis begins as an ugly-looking sore with a hard rim around it, which heals on its own. During the next stage of the disease, you may notice a rash on your body (see Tip 151). This too will disappear on its own. The third and final phase of syphilis is when the infecting germ damages one of the valves (doors) in your heart and/or destroys brain cells, causing mental deterioration. Syphilis is curable if you receive antibiotics when you first notice the sore with the hard rim around it. Therefore if you have a non-painful, raw-looking sore near the genitals and/or mouth, see your doctor as soon as possible. (Also see Appendix C, about syphilis screening.)

                Note: Even if the signs of this disease disappear on their own, it is still very important to get treatment.
