            If your child is experiencing an unexplained fever and/or frequent, sometimes painful urination, he or she may have a urinary tract infection. The child may wet his/her pants or bed, even if he or she is potty trained. The urine may also have  a dark color and/or strong smell. The signs and symptoms in a child are subtle, so it is important to be aware of them and take this condition seriously. Recurrent, untreated urinary tract infections in young children are one of the most common causes of kidney failure.
