<div class="body_contents">
            To avoid premature delivery, contact your doctor immediately for:
            <ul>
<li><b>Bladder infections.</b> Such infections cause frequent urination, pain, and/or burning on urination. They can lead to a serious kidney infection, which can precipitate a premature delivery of the baby and make the mother very ill.</li>
<li><b>A foul or fishy-smelling vaginal discharge due to bacteria.</b> This discharge may need to be treated to avoid pre-mature delivery of the baby.</li>
</ul>
