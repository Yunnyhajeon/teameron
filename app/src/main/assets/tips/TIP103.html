            An injury to the belly area can result in damage to the spleen, and a subsequent life-threatening internal hemorrhage many days after the accident. The warning signals may be worsening or recurring upper-left belly pain, often accompanied by left shoulder pain, and/or suddenly feeling weak or faint. These symptoms may be experienced many days after the injury.

                The spleen is a spongy structure that is structurally similar to a grape, but is larger in size (it has a soft interior, and is covered by a capsule). Located in the upper-left area of the belly cavity, the spleen contains a large quantity of red and white blood cells. A severe blow to the belly area, from an incident such as an auto accident or a sports injury, may damage your spleen. Sudden weakness and/or fainting may indicate a life-threatening internal hemorrhage. If you have these symptoms after this type of injury, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately. (See Tip 7 for more information on dizziness and life-threatening internal bleeding.)

                Sometimes, however, the injury damages the capsule of the spleen, and there is a bulging out of the internal spongy material. The bulging contents may slowly continue to come out, eventually causing profuse bleeding. It can take several days for this to happen, so you may initially experience pain, and then the pain may go away and come back. Or you may develop an upper-left belly pain, which persists and worsens, and is accompanied by pain in your left shoulderâ€”due to the nerve connections running on the inside of your back between the spleen and the left shoulder. Alternatively, you may suddenly become weak and faint hours or even days after the injury. It is very important to watch out for any of these symptoms after a blunt injury to the belly area. Recurring or worsening pain in the upper-left belly area, with or without left shoulder pain, deserves immediate attention at an emergency room.

                If you are suffering from infectious mononucleosis, your spleen is more susceptible to rupture following a blunt injury to your abdomen.
