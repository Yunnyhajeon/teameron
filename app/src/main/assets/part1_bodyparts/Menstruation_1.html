            Too much bleeding at the time of your period, an abnormally long period, or bleeding off and on between periods can be the sign of a serious disease.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Normally your body’s menstrual periods occur every twenty-eight days, give or take seven days, and last approximately four days. If your periods occur less than twenty-one days apart or more than 35 days apart, if they last for more than seven days, or if you experience intermittent bleeding, then you have an abnormal bleeding pattern.
            </p>

            <p>
                Abnormal vaginal bleeding can be an indication of cancer of the uterus (womb). Early diagnosis provides an increased opportunity for treating and curing the two types of uterine cancer—cancer of the cervix (mouth of the womb) and cancer of the endometrium (lining of the womb)—both of which can produce abnormal vaginal bleeding. Remember, this abnormal bleeding does not have to be heavy to indicate cancer; even a small amount of bleeding between normal periods or after intercourse can be significant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Heavy menstrual bleeding can occur from common, usually noncancerous tumors of the wall of the uterus (fibroid tumors, or leiomyomata). These tumors can compress the blood vessels in the wall of the uterus and distort them, prompting heavy vaginal bleeding. They often need to be removed because they can cause severe pain and they have the potential to become so large that they press on other organs, such as the bladder or rectum. There are also medications that may shrink these tumors.
            </p>

            <p>
                An overgrowth of the lining of the womb, though noncancerous, is another cause of excessive and prolonged vaginal bleeding. This condition, usually a result of hormone problems, causes irregular shedding of the lining of the womb and thus abnormal, often heavy, menses. It may be precancerous.
            </p>

            <p>
                Women should begin yearly Pap smears when they become sexually active, but no later than when they turn twenty-one years old. Pap smears can detect cancer of the cervix early, even before abnormal bleeding occurs. (See Appendix C, page 376, for details on Pap smear/pelvic screening.) Note: Pap smears do not detect cancer of the endometrium, and the appearance of abnormal vaginal bleeding is usually the only clue that this type of cancer is present.
            </p>

            <p>
                Birth control pills suppress eggs leaving the ovary and alter the hormone that causes the lining of the uterus to grow. Women who take them may experience sparse periods as a result of a decreased amount of uterine lining growth or increased bleeding due to changes in the hormone level. While scant bleeding is quite normal, heavy bleeding should not continue beyond two months. Report to your doctor any heavy bleeding that soaks more than one pad or tampon every two hours.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fortunately most abnormal vaginal bleeding—whether it’s too much or for too long—is not due to cancer. Usually the cause is more easily treatable. However, seek medical evaluation by your doctor as soon as possible, because even certain noncancerous growths can turn into cancer. Also, continued blood loss can result in a dangerously low blood count (anemia), which may require blood transfusion or treatment with iron.

            If you are not pregnant and you have irregular menses, miss your periods, and/or have fluid leaking from engorged breasts, you may have a tumor of the pituitary gland, which is located on  the undersurface of your brain. Another sign that this may be the case is if you have limited peripheral vision.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The following signs may indicate that you have a tumor of the pituitary gland:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The onset of puberty before the age of nine</li>
                    <li>A sudden abnormal change in your usual pattern of menstruation—for example, missing periods for several months (when not pregnant)</li>
                    <li>A feeling of “fullness” in your breasts or a milky white discharge from your nipples (when not pregnant)</li>
                    <li>Limitations in your peripheral vision. You cannot see objects coming from either side when you are looking straight ahead. Your vision is like that of a horse wearing blinders (see Tip 19).</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                The pituitary gland produces hormones that regulate many other glands in the body. A pituitary tumor alters production of these hormones, which often results in changes in the activity of the glands that the pituitary gland regulates, such as the ovaries, which drive the menstrual cycle, and the breasts, which produce milk. A high level of prolactin, a hormone produced by the pituitary gland, suggests a tumor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The above symptoms are all indications that a tumor may be growing in the pituitary gland. Early medical evaluation and treatment can cure this abnormal growth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Shingles (a painful rash caused by a virus), sexual foreplay with the nipples, hypothyroidism (low thyroid gland function), and medications such as Thorazine and oral contraceptives can also cause nipple discharge.
