            If you have tenderness over your temples and/or blurred vision when you have a headache, you may have a
            serious condition called temporal arteritis.

                Temporal arteritis is a disease (usually occurring in senior citizens) that irritates and inflames the
                walls of your temporal arteries, which run along the side of your head. This disease may cause headaches
                and scalp pain (often noticed when combing oneâ€™s hair), tenderness around the temples, visual
                disturbances, and sometimes cramping of the jaw muscles while chewing. If the inflammation of the
                arteries becomes severe enough, blockage of the arteries (a stroke) may occur. If the artery to one of
                your eyes is blocked, you may also experience blurry vision or even total vision loss.

                A stroke can be prevented if this condition is diagnosed and treated early. A few simple blood tests,
                including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood count
                (CBC), may help your doctor make this diagnosis. To be one hundred percent accurate, he or she may order
                a one-to two-inch biopsy of the temporal artery. While long-term treatment may be necessary to control
                the ailment, immediate treatment may prevent complications. The cause of the disease is unknown.
