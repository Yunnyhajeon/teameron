            Chronic or persistent hoarseness, often with difficulty breathing, may be caused by papilloma (viral induced growths) on the vocal chords. Chronic hoarseness and/or pain when swallowing may be the first signs of gastric reflux. A child with any of these symptoms should be evaluated. If the growths (warts) become large, they can obstruct breathing. Also they can progress farther down the airway and become impossible to treat.

                Children are often hoarse for a short period of time after a coldâ€”or too much shouting! However, if your child (especially a child under five) is hoarse repeatedly or has hoarseness that persists for about a month or more, he/she may need assessment by a pediatric ENT (ear, nose, and throat) doctor who will look in the throat with a scope. Then the doctor will institute proper treatment.

                Note: There is a vaccine that may have value in preventing the growth of these papillomas. (See Appendix C, about the HPV vaccine, Pap smear, and pelvic exam.)

            If your child has become suddenly ill and is drooling, is unable to open his or her mouth wide, has any decrease in the range of motion in his or her neck, cannot swallow liquids (including his/her own saliva), and/or is having difficulty talking or breathing, take your child to the emergency room immediately. Swelling, possibly caused by an infection, could be blocking the child's throat. Another sign that this is the case is if the child refuses to assume any position besides sitting up and forward. Try to keep the child upright.

                Children may not want to eat or drink when sick. But when given a pain or fever reducer, they can usually be convinced to swallow small amounts of cool liquids. If your child refuses to take any liquids, even after being given the correct dose of an over-the-counter pain medicine and especially if they exhibit the above symptoms, you should take them to the emergency room immediately.
