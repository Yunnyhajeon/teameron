            If you are pregnant and you notice tenderness in the upper-right or upper-middle part of your belly (under the breastbone) and/or are experiencing a headache, blurred vision, double vision, dizziness, nosebleeds, swelling, and/or sudden weight gain, immediate medical evaluation is necessary. You may have preeclampsia, a dangerous condition associated with very high blood pressure.

                Preeclampsia can cause severe high blood pressure, which can in turn lead to seizures (eclampsia) and coma. This condition usually appears during the last four months of pregnancy or during the postpartum period.

                The exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown. It begins with changes in the bodyâ€™s blood pressure control mechanisms that cause the blood vessels to constrict. The high blood pressure affects the kidneys, leading to significant weight gain and swelling. As the blood pressure rises to very high levels, you may also develop swelling in the brain and liver, leading to seizures and coma. This cascade of events is usually preventable when early treatment is instituted. The condition of preeclampsia may require delivering the baby early. If you develop the symptoms of preeclampsia, contact your doctor immediately.
