            If you are middle-aged or older and you have sudden lower-left belly pain with intermittent constipation or diarrhea, you may have diverticulitis. In most cases, the pain is persistent. Sometimes, though rarely, it can occur on the right side. If untreated, diverticulitis can cause the colon to rupture, requiring emergency surgery.

                About 25 to 30 percent of Americans over fifty years old have diverticulosis (outpouchings in the colon wall). Diverticula are the small pouches that may be formed in the walls of the colon. As the colon squeezes the breakdown products of food to form stools, weakened areas of the colon wall bulge out, forming these dead-end paths. Note: Some doctors think that this disease is sometimes inherited.

                Diverticula can become irritated and infected (a condition called diverticulitis) from stool that becomes lodged in these pockets and affects the integrity of the lining of the colon. If the infected diverticula burst, the infected material can spread throughout the belly cavity, causing pus pockets; drainage to the skin, bladder, etc.; scarring; and/or blockage of the bowel. Each of these conditions requires emergency surgery. Initially, the sole symptom of this condition may be mild lower-left belly pain. Diverticulitis can usually be treated with antibiotics. You can decrease your chances of developing diverticula by eating high-fiber foods (grains, fruits, and vegetables) and drinking lots of liquids to avoid constipation.

                If you develop sudden lower-left belly pain, especially with a fever, seek immediate medical evaluation.
