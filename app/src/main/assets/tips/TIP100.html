            Upper-middle belly pain, bloody vomit, and/or black tarry stools can be caused by certain pain pills. These medicines can cause ulceration of the stomach and duodenum, which may  lead  to  the hemorrhaging and bursting of the stomach in the area of the ulcer. This problem has resulted in as many as 7,600 deaths in one year in the United States.

                Aspirin, ibuprofen, Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, BC Powder, Goodyâ€™s, and other similar medicines (known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs) are heavily marketed for general pain relief and the relief of the joint pain caused by arthritis. The same medicines are prescribed by doctors in higher dosages for arthritis and other bone and muscle pains. Irritation and ulceration caused by long-term use of these drugs can be life-threatening when it results in hemorrhaging into the stomach or duodenum. You will develop bloody vomit, vomit that resembles coffee grounds in appearance, and/or black tarry bowel movements. Also, the ulcers can burst, causing corrosive chemicals in the stomach to leak into the belly cavity.

                Take these medications only if necessary and only as directed. If you are experiencing belly pain, see your doctor immediately so that you can be evaluated and treated. There are other medications that your doctor can prescribe, along with drugs to prevent ulcer formation. Also, if you are already taking the blood thinners clopidogrel (Plavix) or warfarin (Coumadin), do not take any NSAIDs without first talking to your doctor. The combination of these medicines increases the chance of bleeding. If you experience belly discomfort and are vomiting blood, or if you note black tarry stools, seek emergency medical care. (See Tip 125 for more information on black tarry stools and life-threatening bleeds.)
