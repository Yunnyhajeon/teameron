            If you have had ulcers, you feel full after eating small amounts of food, and you vomit frequently, you may have a blockage from scarring in the stomach or duodenum (the beginning segment of the small intestine). (See Figure 12.)

<p>
                When ulcers of the stomach and duodenum heal, they are replaced with scar tissue. This tissue may shrink or contract, consequently strangling parts of the stomach or duodenum. Multiple ulcers produce multiple scars, sometimes causing blockage of the stomach or duodenum. This is an emergency.

                During surgery the narrowed areas in the stomach or duodenum are opened and the scars are removed. Various segments of the intestines may need to be sewn together to bypass the blocked areas.

                If you are feeling full or vomiting after small meals and have a history of ulcers, see your doctor for medical evaluation and therapy as soon as possible.
