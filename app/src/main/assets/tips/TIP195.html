            If you have a fever and belly discomfort soon after you have given birth to a baby, it may indicate that you have a serious infection of the womb, which could spread rapidly. Heavy bleeding is also a possible warning signal of a life-threatening hemorrhage.

<p>
            You may already be home after delivering your baby when you develop a fever and belly pains. These symptoms may indicate an infection in your uterus (womb). This is dangerous; even a mild infection in this location can become major and spread rapidly throughout your body, because after delivery the internal lining of the uterus has many small blood vessels. Immediate medical evaluation and treatment can be life-saving.

            If you are soaking blood through more than one pad (sanitary napkin) each hour, you are at risk of having a serious hemorrhage. Contact your health-care provider immediately.
