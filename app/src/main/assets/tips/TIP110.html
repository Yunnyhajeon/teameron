            If you have a pulsating bulge in your belly (more noticeable in a person of slender to medium build), it may mean that the aorta, the main vessel coming out of your heart, is ballooning out (aortic aneurysm). This is life-threatening if it leaks or bursts. It may also cause abrupt and/or worsening pain in the lower back, the side, or the abdomen. Sometimes the legs can turn blue and develop some pain. Often, an aneurysm is painless until it begins to leak and/or rupture.

                The aorta, the large artery that leaves the heart, is the main passageway of blood to the rest of the body. It arches in the chest to follow the spinal column into the belly area, where it branches to both legs. If the wall of this blood vessel develops a weak spot, it can bulge out, much like the weak spots on an inner tube. The resulting bulge is called an aneurysm. The danger is that this aneurysm might rupture, causing sudden death from a massive hemorrhage.

                The symptoms of an aortic aneurysm may be as subtle as vague belly pain or back pain, or a blood pressure difference between both arms or an arm and a leg. On the other hand, symptoms may be as obvious as the appearance of a pulsating palpable mass in the belly. The likelihood that an aneurysm will rupture increases as it becomes larger; when it reaches a certain size, it is important to get it repaired immediately, before it can burst.

                Obviously this condition needs to be diagnosed before rupture. Therefore if you note a pulsating bulge and/or sudden severe pain in your side, abdomen or lower back, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately. Occasionally an aneurysm is detected during a routine physical exam, or during a routine abdominal X-ray. (See Appendix C, page 392.) Aneurysms are most often seen in smokers; in people with a family history of aneurysms (i.e., Marfanâ€™s syndrome); in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, and diseases where fatty deposits build up in the arterial wall; and in the elderly. If you have an aneurysm and you suffer sudden, severe back pain, blood in your stools, and/or a change in the color of your legs, with or without sweating and/or weakness, you need immediate transport to emergency medical care.
