            When your child has an asthma attack, you need to recognize the symptoms and know how to react immediately. The key to treating asthma is to prevent an attack from becoming severe (symptoms of a severe attack include struggling to breath, difficulty speaking, possibly turning blue, etc.). You can do this by responding appropriately to the first symptoms, which will be more innocuous and will include coughing, wheezing, etc. You also need to learn what triggers severe attacks of asthma for your child and try to specifically avoid these triggers. For many children with severe or persistent asthma symptoms, being placed on daily inhaled steroids can significantly improve quality of life with minimal to no side effects.

                Nine million children in the United States have been diagnosed with asthma. A severe attack can rapidly become life threatening in a child, whereas a mild attack may be managed carefully with home treatment using inhaled medication. The treatment at home should be conducted in consultation with the child’s physician. This involves using a nebulizer or metered dose inhaler that contains a bronchodilator to open up the airway and an inhaled steroid that reduces inflammation of the airway. The metered dose inhaler is most effective when used with a spacer.

                You need to be able to recognize a severe attack immediately. The child will struggle to breathe, will be unable to speak easily or walk across the room, and will possibly even turn blue. The loudness of the wheeze is irrelevant, and in fact a “silent chest” is even more serious. Call an ambulance (911 in most locations), and while you are waiting, start your child on their emergency medication (such as albuterol), if you have it. (See Tips 57 and 211 for more information on asthma attacks.)

                Be sure that the child’s medicine is constantly with them, even when you are not. Get a refill as soon as you start running low on the medication; do not wait until the next asthma attack.
