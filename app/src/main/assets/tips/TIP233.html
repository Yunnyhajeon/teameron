            The loss of basic skills, such as walking and talking clearly, or the regression to behavior such as thumb-sucking, "baby talk," bed-wetting, or wetting themselves is known as developmental regression. It has a number of serious causes and the affected child should be thoroughly evaluated.

                Occasionally when a child has been ill or has had a major emotional upset—such as the arrival of a new brother or sister— he or she may temporarily lose recently acquired skills, such as potty-training. But a child who loses several skills progressively, especially if there is no obvious reason, should be evaluated by a physician. There are many possible causes, including brain disorders, a tumor, HIV infection, child abuse, a mental or learning disability, or autism.
