            Learn to recognize the chest discomfort of a heart attack. Emergency medical care can save your life.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Your heart requires nourishment from blood that travels in three small but vital vessels on the surface of your heart. If one of these vessels becomes blocked by a blood clot (thrombus) forming at an area that has been narrowed by a cholesterol plaque, part of your heart muscle will be damaged. This process is a heart attack, and immediate emergency care is necessary since your heart may go into spasm and stop.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pain and tightness of a heart attack occurs classically in the center or left side of the chest under the breastbone, and may extend into the right or left arm. Common variations include pain near the front base of the neck, or in the jaw (see Figure 5). Jaw pain sometimes may be felt as pain in the lower teeth. In some cases, the pain may instead appear across the entire chest or between the shoulder blades.  
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The character of the chest pain can be crushing or pressure-like, and is often described as a constricting or squeezing feeling. It can also resemble indigestion, and feel as though belching will make it go away. Or it may feel like a tingling or burning sensation. The severity of the pain does  not correlate with the severity of the heart attack; mild or even slight pain can mean a severe heart attack. Some heart attacks are actually pain free, especially in women, diabetics, or senior citizens.
            </p>

            <p>
                Intermittent pain, lasting usually twenty minutes or less, may be a symptom of angina, particularly if it occurs with activity and is relieved by rest (see Tip 76 for the explanation of angina), but if the pain lasts for thirty minutes continuously, you are more than likely having a full-blown heart attack. Other important symptoms include breaking out in a cold sweat, extreme weakness, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, feeling faint, and/or shortness of breath.
            </p>

            <p>
                If treatment is started early enough (the sooner the better, especially if within hours), the doctor may be able to prevent damage to the heart. He or she may use any of a number of procedures, including dissolving the clot (clot busters), inserting a ballooning catheter to open the blood vessel, using a device called a stent to prop the blood vessel open, etc. (see Figure 6). If surgery to bypass the blocked blood vessel is necessary, the surgeon will attach a vein from your leg or an artery from your chest muscle to the blocked vessel above and below the blockage so that blood can flow around it. Sometimes treatment involves only the use of medicines. (Also see Appendix C, for information on heart disease screening.)

            If you think you are having a heart attack with symptoms such as chest pain, chew one regular, full-strength aspirin (or four 81 mg low-dose aspirin tablets) immediately, unless you are allergic to aspirin. It could save your life. Also, get to an emergency room immediately.

                It may seem ridiculous to take something as simple as an aspirin for something as serious as a heart attack, but it does help prevent damage to the heart muscle during a heart attack. Your heart has three small but vital blood vessels on its surface. These arteries provide the blood that nourishes the heart muscle itself. If fatty substances such as cholesterol start to clog up the vessels, they become narrowed and eventually only a small amount of blood can pass through. It is like a small pea stuck in a straw, with only a little opening around the pea. Eating a lot of fatty and/or salty foods, smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes increase the chance that the pea ruptures, creating the perfect setting for a blood clot to form, which can then, in turn, completely block the artery. This will ultimately cause a heart attack, because no blood will be able to pass through to provide oxygen and nourishment to the heart muscle. Part of your heart muscle will consequently be damaged, and you may develop chest pain. Depending on the location and degree of the damage to the heart, different things can happen: The heart may beat irregularly, the heart may become weak and lose its pumping strength, or the heart may stop pumping altogether.
            </p>

            <p>
                Aspirin (not Tylenol or other pain medications) actually “unsticks” the components of the blood known as platelets, which contribute to forming the clot. If you chew an aspirin when you initially feel chest pain, the blood clot may partially dissolve or at least stop forming. Some blood will then be able to pass around the fatty blockage and therefore continue to deliver oxygen to the heart muscle, preventing a more serious heart attack.

            If you experience episodes of chest pain, tightness, and burning that extend to the neck, throat, jaw, and/or left shoulder and upper arm, usually lasting less than twenty minutes, you may be experiencing angina. This discomfort often occurs with exertion, but sometimes occurs during rest or sleep. It is often a precursor to a heart attack and needs immediate evaluation and treatment.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Your heart muscle has three small but vital blood vessels on its surface. When one or more of these blood vessels becomes partially blocked, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen and nutrition. Subsequent changes in the heart muscle irritate its nerve supply, producing pain. Elderly patients, who are more likely to experience painless heart attacks than younger patients, are also more likely to experience angina without this classic squeezing chest pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Angina differs from a heart attack in that the artery supplying the heart muscle is not totally blocked by fat or blood clots, while in a heart attack the blockage is total. If you have a heart attack, the lack of oxygen and nutrition persists, the chest pain continues, and part of the heart muscle is irreversibly damaged.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pain from angina often appears when you exert yourself, either mildly (shaving or walking up stairs) or more strenuously (lifting objects or exercising). It typically disappears with the cessation of exertion. However, it should be noted that angina can also occur without exertion, sometimes during rest or sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Watch out for these symptoms—if you have angina, you are at a much higher risk of having a heart attack. The partially blocked artery that is causing your angina is susceptible to total blockage by a blood clot. Anyone having angina attacks should have a thorough heart evaluation, which may include an EKG while exercising, a heart scan, and a catheterization to examine the arteries that nourish the heart. (Also see Appendix C, for more about heart disease screening.)
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many effective medical treatments for angina. It is urgent that you go to the emergency room in the following situations, which may be red light warning signals of an impending heart attack:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first time you notice you have angina</li>
                    <li>Angina when you are at rest</li>
                    <li>Angina that wakes you up at night</li>
                    <li>A change in the pattern of your angina pain, such as becoming more severe, more frequent, or longer lasting</li>

                This is the classic pain pattern of a dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. The thoracic aorta, the huge artery where blood flows from the heart, is the main thoroughfare in the distribution of blood to all parts of the body. The aortic wall is made up of three layers and is constantly subjected to pulsating pressure from the heartbeat, especially when your blood pressure is too high. This kind of stress can weaken and tear the inner layer of the aortic wall, allowing blood to work its way into the wall itself. This will cause the layers to separate in a process called dissection. An aneurysm occurs when the weakened wall of the heart balloons out. This constitutes a true medical emergency—you need to be taken to an emergency room as quickly as possible. If the aneurysm ruptures through the outer wall of the aorta, massive bleeding and death will follow. Note: There are inherited disorders that increase your chance of having an aortic aneurysm. If you have a family member who has been diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, you need to be evaluated.

                Other possible causes of this type of pain include a stomach ulcer that has broken through the stomach wall, pancreatic inflammation, and gallbladder disease. All of these conditions warrant immediate medical evaluation.

            A sudden sharp pain on the side of your chest  with shortness of breath may indicate a  collapsed lung (pneumothorax). This and some other causes of these symptoms (see Tip 61) require emergency treatment.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                When you breathe in, your lungs are full of air, and they still contain air when you breathe out. If there is a leak of air from the surface of the lung into the chest cavity, this leaked air can collapse the lung. If this happens, you will experience a sudden, sharp pain on the side of your chest, followed by shortness of breath.
            </p>

            <p>
                A common cause of a collapsed lung is the rupture of a small balloon-like weakened area on the lung’s surface (called a bleb). You may be born with such a weak spot, but it usually will not rupture until late adolescence or early adulthood. This occurs most commonly in tall, thin young men, particularly during exertion. Recurrence is frequent because those who have one weak spot on the lung often have many.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, a smoker who has emphysema might experience this kind of rupture. It can also occur if the chest wall is punctured, such as in an accident. Air gets into the chest cavity, which presses on and then collapses the lung.
            </p>

            <p>
                A collapsed lung constitutes a medical emergency, especially if the remaining lung is diseased. If the other organs in the chest, including the heart and major blood vessels, shift their position because of the collapsed lung, they may encroach on the remaining lung. Emergency treatment is necessary to re-expand the collapsed lung because this condition can compromise the function of the other lung, leading to an inability to breathe and, consequently, death.

            Pain under the breastbone after a vomiting episode,  especially  if  bright  red  blood  is  vomited, may indicate a tear in the lining of the esophagus. Usually, the person has retched or vomited multiple times before blood appears in the vomit.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The esophagus is the muscular tube that takes food from the throat, through the chest, to the stomach. Food does not just fall through the tube, but is squeezed through it by a wave of muscles in the wall of the esophagus. When vomiting occurs, the reverse happens: The stomach contracts, moving material into the esophagus, where the esophagus grabs it and—with a reversed wave of muscle contraction—hurls it out of the mouth. During episodes of severe vomiting, the squeezing of the muscle wall of the esophagus can be powerful enough to tear the lining of the lower esophagus near the opening to the stomach. A life-threatening hemorrhage or infection may follow.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wall of the esophagus can also weaken. Continued vomiting may lead to rupture, which is often fatal. Early signs of this condition indicate the need for emergency medical treatment.

            Tenderness and pain in the back of your lower leg, chest pain, and/or shortness of breath, occurring after sitting for a long time (e.g., after a long airplane trip), or after lying in bed for an extended period of time, are symptoms of a potentially dangerous blood clot.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A blood clot can form in your leg during a long trip in a car or an airplane or when you are bedridden for even a short time. The sitting and lying positions cause more pooling of blood in the legs than standing does. When your legs are still, lack of leg-muscle activity results in less blood flowing up from the legs. The blood that pools in your legs is more likely to clot. When this happens, the back lower part of your leg, in the area of the calf, gets swollen, painful, and tender to the touch (see Figure 7). If this is accompanied by sudden chest pain or shortness of breath, a piece of a blood clot formed in your leg may have broken off and traveled through the bloodstream to your lungs. You need to be taken to an emergency room immediately, because this condition can cause life-threatening damage to your lungs.

            </div>

            <p>
                The formation of blood clots can often be prevented if you take short walks to break up long periods of sitting. If you are taking a long trip, occasionally get up and stroll down the aisle of the airplane or stop the car and step outside for a break. Drink plenty of water so you don’t become dehydrated. Don’t drink alcohol, which causes you to urinate frequently and lose more fluid. If you are bedridden, try to take short walks, even if it is only to the bathroom and back. (See Tip 139 for other causes of blood clots forming in the leg.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: If you have had blood clots in your legs before, you are at a higher risk for getting blood clots in the future. This is especially true if you have been prescribed blood thinners by your doctor and have not been taking them.

            Chest pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath (pleurisy) may indicate a blood clot, pneumonia, injury to the chest wall, a collapsed lung, a tumor in the lung, or other lung diseases.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Pleurisy is not a disease but a symptom. It is an irritation of the membrane (pleura) that lines the walls of the chest and the surface of the lung. The pleura is very smooth, slick, and moist, so as to decrease the friction between the lung and the chest wall during the expansion and deflation of the breathing cycle. If the pleura becomes irritated, swollen, or roughened, a sharp, stabbing pain will often occur when the lung and the chest wall rub against each other during breathing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pleurisy makes you feel as though your breath is being cut off. Pneumonia is a common cause; it inflames the tissue near the surface of your lung, which can then spread to the pleura. Note: It is possible to have pneumonia without having pleurisy. A blood clot in the lung, a viral infection, a growth in the lung, an injury to the chest wall, a collapsed lung, lupus, and other diseases affecting the lungs may also cause pleurisy if the lining of the lung is inflamed.
            </p>

                If you experience chest pain that worsens with a deep breath, emergency medical evaluation and therapy are necessary.

            Chest pain that is worse when you are lying down but gets better when you sit up and bend forward may be caused by inflammation of the sac that holds the heart. This inflammation may lead to the accumulation of fluid in the sac, which will interfere with the filling and pumping of the heart.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The heart is contained in a saclike structure called the pericardium. This compartment is located in the left side of the chest, and if inflamed, will cause pain in that area. Inflammation (swelling and irritation) of this sac is usually caused by a viral infection. It can also occur from a bacterial infection, the spread of a cancerous growth from the lung, the waste products released in the blood when the kidneys fail, or after a heart attack or some heart surgeries. Also, certain medications (procainamide, hydralazine, and the tuberculosis medicine isoniazid), can cause a lupus-like disease that may result in inflammation of the pericardium.
            </p>

            <p>
                Both the severe chest pain and the often associated shortness of breath produced by this condition (called pericarditis) may be similar to the pain from pleurisy, pneumonia, or even a heart attack. The special characteristic of pericarditis is that the pain is often worse when you lie flat on your back. Sitting up and bending forward can ease the pain by relieving the pressure on the sac that contains the heart. This does not mean that you absolutely have pericarditis, but you should see a doctor immediately for evaluation.
            </p>

            <p>
                A potential complication of this disease is the weeping of fluid from the sac wall into the compartment around the heart. If a large amount of this fluid accumulates, it can compress the heart such that it cannot effectively pump blood throughout the body, resulting in the failure of other organs. This is referred to as cardiac tamponade. It is important to have pericarditis diagnosed immediately so you can receive treatment and/or close monitoring of the ailment.
