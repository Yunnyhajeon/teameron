            If you currently smoke or have a history of smoking and find it difficult to breathe, or experience persistent coughing, you may have significant emphysema, which could eventually kill you. You should be evaluated by a physician. These symptoms can also be signs of new or other long-term lung diseases, including cancer.

                Shortness of breath in a smoker can be the first sign of emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease, or pneumonia. Smokers are more likely to develop these diseases. Emphysema, which is most often caused by smoking, can lead to permanent lung failure and eventually death. Discovering that you have emphysema should be a stimulus to stop smoking.

                Emphysema traps air inside of the microscopic air sacs that make up the lungs. When air enters these air sacs, it has trouble getting out, due to the spasm and destruction of the walls of the tiny air passages that lead to the air sacs, and the secretions in the air passages prompted by irritation from smoke. As a result, the tiny air sacs become overinflated, and they no longer empty all of their contents when air is exhaled. This means that there is a considerable amount of dead air (air poor in oxygen) in the lungs, which leaves less room for fresh air. Also, since these sacs are where the body normally obtains its oxygen for the blood, a reduction of available oxygen in the air sacs reduces the bodyâ€™s total supply of oxygen.

                At first, you may not notice that your breathing is becoming impaired. Long before abnormalities appear on a chest X-ray or you have difficulty breathing, changes can be detected with lung-function testing. Lung-function testing involves breathing into a machine that makes several measurements, including the total lung volume as well as the rate of air flow into and out of the lungs. The primary measurement for diagnosing the severity of the emphysema is the amount of air exhaled from the lung during the first second. If you smoke, ask your doctor about a lung-function test. Pay attention to the results.

                If you smoke and are short of breath, it is necessary that you see a doctor immediately to rule out emphysema, pneumonia, lung cancer, and other ailments.
