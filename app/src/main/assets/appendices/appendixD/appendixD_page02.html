                parents and children, but it is definitely less accurate. Using a thermometer rectally should almost always be safe and reliable when done correctly (see instructions on the following pages for the proper use of a rectal thermometer). A digital thermometer usually registers a rectal temperature within a minute, while a glass rectal thermometer takes two to three minutes to register the temperature.</p>

<p><b>Axillary (Under the Arm)</b></p>
<p>
For babies and children up to four years of age, an axillary temperature can be taken as an alternative to a rectal temperature. Most standard digital thermometers will work for this, although thermometers specifically designed for the armpit are available. It typically takes under a minute to register an axillary temperature with a digital thermometer. If you are using a glass thermometer, either a rectal or oral thermometer will work. It normally takes three to four minutes to register an axillary temperature with a glass thermometer.
</p>
<p>
Make sure to hold the thermometer snugly in the armpit with the bulb completely covered between the child’s arm and side. Keep in mind that an axillary reading is not as accurate as a rectal or oral temperature, and is often lower than the actual core temperature.
</p>

<p><b>Ear or Forehead (Temporal Artery)</b></p>
<p>
Either of these kinds of thermometers is an alternative to the rectal or axillary thermometer. There is no uniform consensus about how much more or less accurate than an axillary temperature they are. If you decide to use an ear or forehead thermometer, always be sure to read the instructions to be sure you are using it properly. It may be wise to also ask your child’s physician or nurse to show you how to properly position it to ensure that you get as consistent and accurate a reading as possible.

<p>
When using an ear thermometer, it is important to place it in the right location in the ear and at the proper angle. Remember also that the outside temperature may influence the reading (for example, a child’s ears may be cold from being outside in cool air). When using the forehead thermometer, keep in mind that there are some situations where the forehead is cool, even though the core body temperature is elevated. This can be due to narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the forehead with blood.
</p>

<p><b>Oral</b></p>
<p>
When the child is cooperative and at least four years old, taking an oral temperature is recommended. Make sure that the child keeps his/her mouth closed with the thermometer held underneath the tongue. A digital thermometer usually takes less than a minute to
