                <ul>
                        <li>Move your fingers around all parts of the breast, using a sequence of three different motions. Make sure you check the entire breast area between your ribs and your collarbone  (clavicle):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, use an overlapping, dime-size, circular motion.</li>
                            <li>Second, use an in-and-out motion with three different levels of pressure—light, medium, and firm—so that you can feel the tissue closest to the skin, the tissue that’s a little deeper, and the tissue closest to the chest and ribs. Use each level of pressure before moving your hand to the next spot. You may want to talk to your doctor or nurse about how hard to press.</li>
                            <li>Third, a vertical up-and-down pattern, starting at the underarm and moving across the breast to the middle of your torso or sternum (breastbone).</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Examine your breasts while taking a shower. Soapy hands over wet skin make it easy to check for lumps. Use a similar technique to the one noted earlier.</li>
                <li>Put the pillow under your left shoulder, and repeat the above steps, this time with your left breast.</li>
                <li>Stand in front of a mirror with your hands pressed firmly on your hips, and note any changes in the way your breasts look, such as dimpling of the skin, changes in the nipple, changes in the texture of the skin (so that it resembles an orange peel), redness, or swelling (see Figure 19).</li>
