            A child who has a fever (usually over 101 degrees), flu-like symptoms, possibly a stiff neck, and a rash that does not disappear when pressure is applied to it could have a serious bacterial infection (meningococcosis). He or she should be brought to the emergency room immediately. Note: The rash may appear faint and pink, or it may be flat, blotchy, and red or purple. It could also look like blood spattering or tiny pinpricks.
