                <p><b>How to Help an Infant Under the Age of One:</b></p>
<i>Note: If it is a child with croup, suspected epiglottitis, or asthma (see Tips 210 and 211), do not undertake these procedures unless he/she cannot utter a sound and is clearly choking.</i>

            </p>

                <b>IN THE CASE OF A CONSCIOUS  INFANT</b>
                <ul>
                            <li><b>Position:</b> Place the infant face down on your arm, with the child’s head and neck below his/her trunk (e.g., on your knee). Support his or her neck and head with one hand.</li>
                            <li><b>Action:</b> Using the heel of your other hand, give him/her approximately five firm, quick blows between the shoulder blades, forcefully enough to expel the object. The object should come out.</li>
                            <li><b>If no success:</b> Turn the infant face up on your lap or on a firm surface, and support his/her head and neck with one hand. Use two fingers of your other hand to thrust inward and upward five times in the center of the breastbone, one finger-width below the nipple line. Watch the mouth, and remove the offending object with your pinky finger as soon as it appears.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Continue the above maneuvers (five back blows, five chest thrusts) until one of two things happens: the object is expelled and the infant begins to cry, or the infant becomes unconscious or unresponsive.

                    Some paragraphs will have lists. To insert a list:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Item1</li>
                            <li>Item2</li>
                            <li>Item3</li>
                        </ul>

                    ex: <p> My list is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Item1</li>
                                <li>Item2</li>
                                <li>Item3</li>
                            </ul>

                            This is my list. 
                        </p>

                <ul>
                            <li><b>If still no success:</b> Call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
                            <li><b>Position:</b> Turn the infant faceup on a hard surface (tabletop, counter, or floor).</li>
                            <li><b>Action:</b> Look in the mouth for any object on which the infant could be choking. If you see anything, use your pinky finger to remove the object. Do not blindly sweep fingers into the infant’s mouth.</li>
                            <li>If you are unable to see anything, open the airway by tilting the head back very slightly (if at all), put your mouth over the baby’s nose and mouth, and give 2 gentle breaths (puffs of air, using only the amount of air you can hold in your cheeks).</li>
                            <li>Watch to see if the chest rises and falls.
                                <li>If the chest does not rise and fall, the airway may still be blocked. Immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two attempted breaths. (See the following guidelines on CPR.) Check the mouth for the object each time you are about to provide a breath. Do not reach into the infant’s mouth unless you see an object to remove. </li>
