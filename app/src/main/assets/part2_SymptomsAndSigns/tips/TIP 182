            If someone has passed out, it is extremely important to know whether they lost consciousness because of a seizure. Seizures can be recurrent and warrant specific treatment. They can also be a sign of an abnormality in the brain or an emergency life-threatening condition such as very low blood sugar or a serious electrolyte abnormality in the blood.
