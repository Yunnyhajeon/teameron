            Enlargement of the fingertips—such that they become wider, the nails become deformed, and they develop a
            clublike appearance—can be an important sign of a serious disease.

                Enlargement of the ends of the fingers in a clublike fashion occurs subtly and without pain, therefore
                attracting little attention or concern. The important consideration is that they are a common sign of
                diseases that impair the oxygenation of the blood. It is thought that certain heart diseases, as well as
                some diseases of the lung, liver, and bowel—including cancer—can also be associated with these
                deformities. So if club fingertips appear, make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to
                find out why.
