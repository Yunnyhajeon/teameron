Starting at age thirty, any woman who has had three normal Pap test results and negative HPV (human papilloma virus) tests in a row may choose to be screened every two to three years instead of annually. However, women should continue to be screened every year if they have certain risk factors such as exposure before birth to DES (diethylstilbestrol, a specific type of estrogen), an HIV infection, or a weakened immune system (which could be due to organ transplant therapy, chemotherapy, or chronic steroid use). If a woman has no risk factors, is over the age of seventy, and has had three normal Pap test results in a row along with ten consecutive years without an abnormal Pap test, she may choose to discontinue cervical cancer screenings. Also, a woman of any age who has no risk factors and has had a total hysterectomy (unless it was done as a treatment for cervical cancer or pre-cancer) may want to discuss with her doctor the option of discontinuing her routine Pap smears. However, these women should continue to have their doctor perform a routine exam of the pelvic area.

<p><b>Pelvic Exam/Ovarian Cancer Screening</b></p>
Ovarian cancer can sometimes be found during a pelvic exam, but it would be much more valuable to pick it up before it is advanced enough to be detected by the doctor in this way. At the time of the writing of this book, it appears that there is not enough data to come up with an absolute policy of routine ovarian cancer screening. If you are at risk, it may be recommended that you get a more thorough evaluation than the routine pelvic exam. You can assess your risk factors by going to www.wcn.org for a confidential questionnaire. If you are at moderate risk, your doctor may recommend a test known as CA125 radioimmunoassay, and possibly a transvaginal ultrasound. If you are at high risk, you should consider seeing a genetic counselor who is an expert in this area. He/she will likely recommend further testing.

<p><b>Sexually Transmitted Diseases </b></p>
<p><b>(Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis)</b></p>
One of the most important STDs to test for is chlamydia. It doesn’t always cause symptoms, however it’s important to diagnose and treat it because it can—if left untreated—lead to infertility. All sexually active women are at risk and should be screened for it. Additional factors that put women at an even greater risk include sexual activity under the age of twenty-five and high-risk sexual behaviors at any age. High-risk sexual behaviors include multiple partners (or a partner with multiple sexual partners), intercourse without a condom with more than one partner, and shared sex toys. Victimization by sexual assault also increases the risk. Women with pelvic inflammatory
