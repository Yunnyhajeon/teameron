            If you experience more shortness of breath than normal during and/or after mild exertion, particularly if you also have a rapid pulse, you may have a serious medical problem, usually in your lungs or heart.

<p>
                Normally you get short of breath and your heart speeds up when you exert yourself, such as when you run up a flight of stairs. But if your shortness of breath and/or rapid pulse continue too long after rest (usually three minutes or more), or if they occur with very mild exertion, then you may have a heart-lung problem, a low blood count, or another serious illness. Seek immediate medical evaluation and therapy.
