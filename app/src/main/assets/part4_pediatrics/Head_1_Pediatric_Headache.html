            A child with a headache, a stiff and/or painful neck, and fever should always be seen by a doctor immediately to rule out meningitis. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Children with meningitis often refuse to eat and want to be left alone.

                Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain. It is most common in infants, who usually do not show specific signs (see Tip 232 for additional important information on meningitis in infants). Bacterial meningitis is more serious than the viral type, and early diagnosis can dramatically reduce the chances of deafness, cognitive impairment, and death.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child has the above symptoms, especially if they are accompanied by photophobia (sensitivity to light), he or she must be seen on an emergency basis by a doctor. In the early stages of meningitis, the child may not have a stiff neck.
            </p>

            <p>
                Early treatment with intravenous antibiotics has a high cure rate (see Tip 3 for additional information on meningitis).

            Headaches in young children, especially when associated with vomiting or visual disturbances, should be taken very seriously and investigated by a physician.

                Brain tumors are the most common type of childhood tumor. The early diagnosis of certain tumors can have a major impact on the child’s survival.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the cause of your child’s headache is a brain tumor, then the increasing pressure on the brain will cause headaches, usually in the morning, and these may be accompanied by vomiting and visual disturbances, most often double vision. Other symptoms may include unsteadiness during walking, slow growth in height, early puberty, seizures, or a personality change. Headaches can be caused by many non-serious conditions too, but it is important to have your child assessed and thoroughly evaluated as soon as possible.

            Adolescents or young adults who experience headaches that get progressively more severe over a few days or longer, along with visual changes, may have a rare but treatable condition in which the pressure on the brain is increased. While not usually life threatening, it can cause serious complications such as a permanent loss of vision.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                This condition, known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is most common in adolescent girls. Usually the cause is unknown, but it may occasionally be the result of factors such as a hormonal imbalance, a drug side effect (for example, it could be caused by tetracycline and/or other medicines used for adolescent skin conditions), high doses of vitamin A, or obesity. Frequently no specific origin can be found.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first step toward diagnosis is a brain scan, as this will help exclude other causes of increased pressure of the fluid around the brain, such as a tumor. If the scan is negative, a spinal tap can be used to detect when there is very high pressure of the fluid on the brain. This condition is important to diagnose because it may cause symptoms similar to a brain tumor but has a much better outcome. See your doctor as soon as possible for assessment and possible referral to a neurologist (brain specialist).

            Carbon monoxide gas is odorless and tasteless, and inhaling it can be fatal. If your child is in an enclosed area and starts developing headaches, possibly with nausea and vomiting, and especially if others in the area begin experiencing similar symptoms, it may be due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Symptoms are often subtle and may include weakness and/or drowsiness, which can cause one to fall asleep rather than evacuating the contaminated area. A more distinctive sign is that your lips and gums may turn cherry red. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you must evacuate the area and seek urgent medical treatment. Children and pets will usually be affected first.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Sources such as a leaking gas furnace, pipe, or water heater may result in carbon monoxide poisoning. Using a charcoal grill, camp stove, or kerosene heater without proper ventilation, leaving a car running in an enclosed area, or inhaling fumes from a boat motor are other common causes of carbon monoxide poisoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes the sources are not immediately apparent. Inexpensive carbon monoxide monitors are sold in most hardware or department stores and will alert you to dangerous gas levels. Consider installing one on each level of your home or boat. Have your home heating system (including chimneys) checked and cleaned by a professional each year, and if you use any kind of boat with a motor, the engine and exhaust system should be checked regularly as well. If you develop any of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning while in your car, get the exhaust system checked and make sure there are no holes in the floorboard.

            </p>

            <p>
                Though any children in the area will probably come down with symptoms first, carbon monoxide poisoning can kill both children and adults quickly. If several people in the household develop headaches simultaneously and/or become drowsy, everyone should leave the house immediately. Call the gas company, and get emergency medical attention.

            If your child experiences a head injury, is initially fine, and then becomes abnormally drowsy, vomits or develops other symptoms within hours or sometimes even days following an injury, he or she may be experiencing bleeding inside the head. This is an emergency! Any loss of consciousness, even for a short period of time, requires immediate medical evaluation.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                After a significant injury to the head, slow bleeding may start inside the skull, and the child may gradually get drowsy due to the increasing pressure within his or her head. If your child injures his/her head and initially seems fine, observe him/her closely for at least the next two or three days. This includes waking the child every hour for the first six hours following the injury to make sure he/she has not lost consciousness, and then every four hours for the next eighteen hours. Go to the hospital emergency room or call an ambulance (911 in most locations) if your child gets more drowsy, experiences weakness or jerking on one side of the body, and/or develops double vision, personality changes, speech problems, loss of sensation, seizures, dizziness, a headache, or any other major changes (see Tip 10 for more information on head injuries). If your child has lost consciousness, even for a short period of time, have him or her evaluated immediately.

            If your child has a fever and starts convulsing (having seizures), it is important for you to know how to react. The convulsions may affect only one side of the body and/or the child may possibly turn blue. Regardless of how long the convulsions last, you should follow the safety steps described below and call an ambulance. The child will need to be evaluated by a physician.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Children between the ages of six months and six years with a high fever are at risk of convulsing. This condition is known as a febrile seizure. It is more common in children with a family history of febrile seizures. This type of seizure will usually occur early in an illness, during the first spike of fever. It might even be the first sign that the child has a fever. If the temperature rises quickly, febrile seizures are more likely to occur. They can last anywhere from a few seconds to over fifteen minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is upsetting to see your child convulsing. Try to be calm and do the following:

                <ul>
                    <li>Lay your child on his/her side with his/her face tilted toward the floor to prevent him/her from choking on any food or fluids in the mouth. Do not try to restrain him or her.
                    </li>
                    <li>Do not try to insert your fingers or a spoon into the mouth. It will do more harm than good: You may block his/her airway or lose a finger! A bulb syringe can be used to clear the nose.
                    </li>
                    <li>FeverAll is a fever-reducing medicine like Tylenol, which is inserted in the rectum instead of given orally. It is equally as effective as Tylenol, and can be used in a child who is convulsing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Call an ambulance (911 in most locations). If it is the first episode and the child is under eighteen months, medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible causes such as meningitis. In all cases, you should notify your child’s doctor about the seizure.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the child’s outer clothes immediately after the seizure if they are bundled up in a lot of clothing. If the child gets too warm, the temperature may rise again. On the other hand, avoid letting the child get chilled, since this can also make the temperature go back up. Many doctors warn against giving the child a bath, as this may cause the child to get chilled. Other doctors say that it’s okay, as long as the bath is short and the water is not too hot or cold (i.e., lukewarm), especially if the fever is 104˚F (40˚C) or higher. If the child shivers, cover him/ her with a light blanket or light layer of clothing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not give the child anything to eat or drink immediately after the seizure until he or she is able to respond to you. Then, if you haven’t given the child FeverAll during the seizure, give him/her a fever-reducing medicine other than aspirin (ibuprofen or an acetaminophen, such as Tylenol). Never give a child aspirin unless it has been specifically recommended by the child’s pediatrician.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child has had a febrile convulsion, he or she has about a 30 percent chance of having another seizure associated with the onset of a fever. Speak to your child’s doctor about special precautions to prevent future febrile seizures. These include the use of medicines to keep the temperature down or to stop the seizures. The risk continues to decrease over time. Less than 2 percent of children with simple febrile seizures will go on to develop epilepsy. For a child with a simple febrile convulsion, there is no association with learning difficulties later in life. All febrile seizures warrant medical evaluation.

            Convulsions in a baby can be very subtle. If your baby has unusual rhythmic movements, especially in the face, eyes, or limbs, call a doctor.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                In adults, the most common type of convulsion is a generalized one, where the whole body shakes violently and the person becomes unaware of his or her surroundings. In babies, especially in the first month of life, seizures are less obvious. Watch for the repetitive “cycling” of one leg which lasts for around a minute, smacking movements of the lips, eyes or head deviating to one side, or eye twitching. These may be the only signs of a convulsion in an infant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let your doctor know as soon as possible if your baby exhibits these kinds of repeated unusual rhythmic movements, especially in the context of other problems such as feeding difficulties or a complicated delivery. Keep a record and description of these episodes, so that he or she can make the appropriate diagnosis.
