            In women, senior citizens, and diabetics a general sense of weakness and/or shortness of breath without any chest pain may be the only warning sign of a heart attack.

<p>
                The pain of a heart attack usually occurs in the center of the chest, under the breastbone or in the front-left breast area. The pain is most often a sensation of pressure, like a heavy weight on the chest or a squeezing tightness. Profound weak- ness often accompanies the pain. A cold and clammy sweat may be present, with nausea and vomiting. In some cases, however, a heart attack may occur in an entirely atypical manner.

               If you are a woman, senior citizen, or diabetic, be aware that shortness of breath and/or profound weakness may be the only signs of a “silent” heart attack. Consult your physician immediately for an evaluation, which includes an EKG, blood tests of certain heart chemicals, and special X-rays of the heart, to determine if you are having a heart attack. Life saving treatments may be necessary.
