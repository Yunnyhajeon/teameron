            Some signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) are weakness, a rapid heartbeat, dizziness, confusion, profuse
            sweating, “acting weird,” black outs, seizures, and unconsciousness. An extreme drop in blood sugar can
            occur in diabetics, which can be fatal if left untreated. Drinking fruit juice and putting sugar under the
            tongue can provide immediate relief for these symptoms, but emergency medical evaluation and treatment may
            also be necessary.

                Hypoglycemia means you have a low blood sugar level, numerically, in the forties or lower. At these
                levels you will often become weak, jitter, shake, sweat profusely, develop a rapid heart rate, sometimes
                act “weird” (this behavior is occasionally misdiagnosed as a manic episode of mental illness or as
                intoxication), become dizzy or faint, and/or have seizures followed by unconsciousness. The symptoms of
                hypoglycemia usually occur first thing in the morning or anytime when several hours have elapsed since
                your last meal. If left untreated, it can be fatal.

                Keep in mind that diabetes medication can actually drive the blood sugar so low that it causes these
                problems. Hypoglycemia usually occurs when diabetics take too much insulin or too many oral agents for
                their diabetes, or when they do not consume adequate amounts of appropriate foods.

                Fluctuations in blood sugar levels in diabetics can cause blurred vision due to high amounts of sugar
                pulling water from the lenses of the eyes. The hypoglycemic symptom of shakiness between meals (called
                reactive hypoglycemia) is also common in non-diabetics, particularly after consuming sugar-rich meals.
                Though hypoglycemia is more serious in diabetics, its symptoms can generally be improved in both of
                these cases by eating small, high protein, low carbohydrate meals more frequently.

                A rare cause of very low sugar levels in non-diabetics is a small hormone-producing tumor (insulinoma)
                in the pancreas, which overproduces insulin. Excess insulin then passes into the bloodstream, causing
                hypoglycemia. Most of these tumors are noncancerous and a complete cure can often be obtained by
                removing the tumor.

                If you are on beta-blockers, the medications used to treat hypertension and glaucoma, keep in mind that
                they will occasionally blunt the warning signs that your sugars are getting too low. Some of the common
                beta-blockers are metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol, and timolol. If you are taking one of
                these medications, the only symptom of hypoglycemia you may experience is confusion or weakness.
            </p>

                Note: Hypoglycemia is different from hyperglycemia, which refers to high blood sugar as opposed to low
                blood sugar. However, some of the symptoms are similar. The doctor can distinguish between the two by
                simply testing the blood for sugar levels. The typical symptoms of hyperglycemia are nausea and
                vomiting, increased thirst and urination, decreased appetite, and fatigue. It often occurs when a
                diabetic inappropriately stops their diet, medication, or exercise regimen. Both hypoglycemia and
                hyperglycemia can ultimately be life-threatening if left untreated.
