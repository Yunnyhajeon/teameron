        <h3>What Kind of Thermometer to Use</h3>
    </div>
            <p>
                Most standard digital thermometers can be used either orally, rectally, or under the arm (for an axillary temperature). There are also digital thermometers that are designed for taking temperatures in other specific locations, such as the ear or the forehead. However, these specialized thermometers may not be as widely available and may cost more than a standard digital thermometer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Digital thermometers are easier to read and take a much shorter time to register a temperature than glass thermometers. They are also generally considered safer to use than glass thermometers. If a glass thermometer breaks, there is the danger of broken glass as well as the possible danger of mercury poisoning. However, if you do plan on taking a rectal temperature with a glass thermometer, make sure that the thermometer is one designed specifically for taking a rectal temperature—it should have a round bulb at the tip so that it won’t be sharp against the walls of the rectum. The bulb on the glass oral thermometer is long and thin. Either one of these types of glass thermometers can also be used for an axillary (under the arm) temperature.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p>
                    <b>Rectal</b>
                </p>
                Most emergency room doctors recommend taking a rectal temperature in a young child, especially under six months of age, and ideally up to two years of age, because it gives the most accurate measurement. Taking an axillary temperature might be easier for some parents and children, but it is definitely less accurate. Using a thermometer rectally should almost always be safe and reliable when done correctly (see instructions on the following pages for the proper use of a rectal thermometer). A digital thermometer usually registers a rectal temperature within a minute, while a glass rectal thermometer takes two to three minutes to register the temperature.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Axillary (Under the Arm)</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                For babies and children up to four years of age, an axillary temperature can be taken as an alternative to a rectal temperature. Most standard digital thermometers will work for this, although thermometers specifically designed for the armpit are available. It typically takes under a minute to register an axillary temperature with a digital thermometer. If you are using a glass thermometer, either a rectal or oral thermometer will work. It normally takes three to four minutes to register an axillary temperature with a glass thermometer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Make sure to hold the thermometer snugly in the armpit with the bulb completely covered between the child’s arm and side. Keep in mind that an axillary reading is not as accurate as a rectal or oral temperature, and is often lower than the actual core temperature.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ear or Forehead (Temporal Artery)</b>
                </p>
                Either of these kinds of thermometers is an alternative to the rectal or axillary thermometer. There is no uniform consensus about how much more or less accurate than an axillary temperature they are. If you decide to use an ear or forehead thermometer, always be sure to read the instructions to be sure you are using it properly. It may be wise to also ask your child’s physician or nurse to show you how to properly position it to ensure that you get as consistent and accurate a reading as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                When using an ear thermometer, it is important to place it in the right location in the ear and at the proper angle. Remember also that the outside temperature may influence the reading (for example, a child’s ears may be cold from being outside in cool air). When using the forehead thermometer, keep in mind that there are some situations where the forehead is cool, even though the core body temperature is elevated. This can be due to narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the forehead with blood.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p>
                    <b>Oral</b>
                </p>
                When the child is cooperative and at least four years old, taking an oral temperature is recommended. Make sure that the child keeps his/her mouth closed with the thermometer held underneath the tongue. A digital thermometer usually takes less than a minute to register an oral temperature. With a glass thermometer, it takes two to three minutes to register.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p>
                    <b>A Summary of the Accuracy Issue</b>
                </p>
                A temperature properly taken either orally or rectally is considered to be the most accurate. When taking an oral temperature, the child must keep his/her mouth closed and the thermometer under his/her tongue. Most children cannot do this until they are at least four years of age. Accuracy is very important in identifying an elevated temperature in children under two years of age, and especially in children under six months old. Elevations in temperature can be missed with less accurate axillary (under the arm) measurements. Missing an elevated temperature can have life-threatening consequences in a young child, particularly in an infant.
            </p>

            <p>
                An axillary temperature is generally considered to be lower than the actual core temperature. There is no consensus about the accuracy of other methods, such as the use of the ear or forehead thermometer. Some doctors suggest the use of the ear thermometer as an alternative to taking a rectal or axillary temperature, while others feel it is often inaccurate—the readings can vary greatly depending on the angle at which the thermometer is held within the ear, variations in ear anatomy, and the temperature of the child’s environment (i.e., the ear, itself, may be cold). Some doctors suggest that the forehead (temporal artery) thermometer is a good alternative to taking a rectal or axillary temperature, but others question the accuracy since, in certain circumstances, the forehead may be cooler than the core body temperature. When in doubt—for example, if any of these alternative methods do not register an elevated temperature and you still believe the child has a fever—it may be wise to take a rectal temperature.

                    <li>If using a digital thermometer, begin by pressing the power button and wait until the display appears. Follow the instructions.</li>
                    <li>If you are using a glass thermometer, shake it until it reads below the 97 degrees Fahrenheit mark (36.1 degrees Celsius). Hold the thermometer by the tip and snap your wrist and hand sharply, keeping it over a couch or bed so it won’t break if it slips from your hand.</li>
                    <li>Apply a lubricant like Vaseline or K-Y Jelly to the tip of the thermometer that will be inserted.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Lay the child on his/her stomach.</li>
                <li>Spread the buttocks with one hand and lay the same arm on the child’s back to limit struggling.</li>
                <li>Insert the thermometer gently and slowly about an inch into the rectum. NEVER force the thermometer; it should slide in easily.</li>
                <li>Hold the buttocks together to help keep the thermometer in place. Do not leave the child unattended while waiting for a temperature reading.</li>
                <li>If using a digital thermometer, wait until the display indicates the child’s temperature.</li>
                <li>If using a glass thermometer, wait three minutes before reading the temperature. Slowly turn the thermometer until you see the line of mercury. Each long line represents one full degree and each short line represents 0.2 degrees.</li>
                <li>Wash the thermometer with warm water and soap after each use and store in a safe place.</li>
