            Itching all over without any sign of a rash can indicate cancer, liver disease, kidney disease, a psychological problem, an infection, a blood or glandular illness, or a potentially serious reaction to a medication.

                Most of the time itchiness has an obvious explanation, such as dry skin. But seemingly unwarranted itching can be an early sign of cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia, particularly when associated with a low-grade fever. A diffuse itching, caused by the accumulation of substances normally broken down in the liver, may also be the first sign of liver disease.

                Therefore itching all over your skin may indicate the need for a thorough medical checkup. If it is a sudden onset, particularly after you begin a new medicine, notify your doctor immediately before continuing to take it. The itching may be an early sign of an allergic reaction. If this is the case, a second dose could be life-threatening.
