            An irregular, usually rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: a feeling like “squirrels running around in your chest,” heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. If your pulse suddenly becomes irregular (and usually rapid), you may be experiencing a serious heart rhythm abnormality known as atrial fibrillation.
