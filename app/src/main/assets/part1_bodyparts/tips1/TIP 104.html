            If you are middle-aged or older and you have sudden lower-left belly pain with intermittent constipation or diarrhea, you may have diverticulitis. In most cases, the pain is persistent. Sometimes, though rarely, it can occur on the right side. If untreated, diverticulitis can cause the colon to rupture, requiring emergency surgery.
