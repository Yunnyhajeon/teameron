            Mild or severe upper-middle or left belly pain extending into the back with nausea and/or vomiting may be caused by pancreatitis. The pain is often less severe when sitting up and bending forward, while it worsens when lying flat on your back. Severe cases can cause diabetes, release dangerous chemicals into the blood, and produce internal hemorrhaging. Consumption of alcohol and foods high in fat content can cause this condition or make it much worse.

                The pancreas is a narrow, band-like organ one to two inches wide, extending behind the stomach across the upper belly area for three to six inches toward the left side. It has two major functions: to produce enzymes for the small intestine to digest food, and to make insulin, which is then dispatched into the bloodstream. If the pancreas gets inflamed, the release of its potent enzymes into the bloodstream or the surrounding tissues can make you very ill, causing internal bleeding and widespread tissue damage throughout the body. Destruction of the pancreas can also cause diabetes, since the hormone insulin is necessary to drive sugar from the bloodstream into body cells. Lack of insulin production causes hyperglycemia (high sugar levels in the blood).

                The pancreas can become inflamed as a consequence of gallbladder disease. The gallbladder has a tube in common with the pancreas; if gallstones pass into this tube, they can block the outflow of the digestive chemicals from the pancreas. You can also damage your pancreas by regularly drinking alcohol; if your pancreas becomes inflamed, you should stop drinking alcohol forever. The mumps virus is another possible cause of pancreatitis. The pancreas can sometimes become inflamed without any identifiable cause.

                The symptoms of pancreatitis warrant emergency medical evaluation and treatment, in order to avoid serious complications. Blood studies can document damage in the pancreas.
