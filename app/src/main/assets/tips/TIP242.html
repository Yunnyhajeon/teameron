                    Name confusion seems like a silly and unlikely error, but it happens more than you might think. Don’t take chances.

                        When two patients in the hospital have the same name, or even names that look similar, there is a greater chance of error. You are especially at risk if there is another patient with the same name or a similar name in the treatment area (hospital floor) where you are located.
                    </p>
                    How do you find out if this is the case during your hospital stay? Simply ask the nurse who is caring for you. If the answer is yes, then ask if the hospital has a system for alerting staff members to the coincidence of two patients having similar names. If they don’t, then request special identifiers such as name alerts (which are often either stickers on written charts or red labels on electronic files). In certain cases, it might even be wise to ask to be moved to another area of the hospital. If the nursing staff refuses to cooperate, notify the CEO’s office. There are strict patient privacy rules, but you don’t need to know the identity of the other person to prevent a situation of name confusion. All you need to do is request that the increased risk be addressed.
