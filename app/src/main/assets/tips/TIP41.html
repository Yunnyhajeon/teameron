            If you have a sore throat, followed by fever and joint swelling about two weeks later, watch out. You can get rheumatic fever from strep throat that was inadequately treated.

                Rheumatic fever is a complication of a strep throat that usually occurs two to three weeks after having strep throat. It can cause the joints in your body to become swollen and painful. Fever and swelling are reactions of the body to the infection caused by the streptococcus germ. Rheumatic fever can also cause the heart muscle to become inflamed, and can thereby permanently damage the heart valves.

                While rheumatic fever is most common in children who are between five and fifteen years old, it can also occur in adults. Adequate treatment of the initial sore throat is the secret to preventing rheumatic fever. If your doctor prescribes a course of antibiotics, make sure you take <i>all</i> of the medicine.

                Other complications of a strep infection are acute glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidneys) and scarletina (see scarlet fever, Tip 40), which has the appearance of a red rash.
