            Convulsions in a baby can be very subtle. If your baby has unusual rhythmic movements, especially in the face, eyes, or limbs, call a doctor.

<p>
                In adults, the most common type of convulsion is a generalized one, where the whole body shakes violently and the person becomes unaware of his or her surroundings. In babies, especially in the first month of life, seizures are less obvious. Watch for the repetitive “cycling” of one leg which lasts for around a minute, smacking movements of the lips, eyes or head deviating to one side, or eye twitching. These may be the only signs of a convulsion in an infant.

                Let your doctor know as soon as possible if your baby exhibits these kinds of repeated unusual rhythmic movements, especially in the context of other problems such as feeding difficulties or a complicated delivery. Keep a record and description of these episodes, so that he or she can make the appropriate diagnosis.
