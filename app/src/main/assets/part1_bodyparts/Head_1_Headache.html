            A sudden, agonizing, “thunderclap” headache, more severe than any you have ever experienced, could mean you are bleeding in the brain. This is an emergency.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Most headaches are caused by factors such as stress, sinus infection, seasonal allergies, dehydration, caffeine withdrawal, eye strain, lack of sleep, low blood sugar, or migraines. These types of headaches are usually self-limited and will often go away with rest and/or over-the-counter medication. But if you ever get a sudden, severe headache that you consider the worst headache of your life or that feels different from any headache you have previously experienced, you may have a hemorrhage in your brain. In many cases this occurs after physical exertion. Again, this is a medical emergency.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <b>subarachnoid hemorrhage</b> is the medical term for bleeding around the brain that pools in the subarachnoid space—the space between the skull and the brain. Your skull, which is like a tight-fitting helmet that protects your brain, does not allow room for the blood that accumulates during this kind of hemorrhage. This results in increased pressure on your brain. If the subarachnoid hemorrhage is significant, the blood will continue to accumulate in the skull, which causes spasms of blood vessels, increased fluid in the brain, and increased pressure within the brain. Because the brain has the consistency of Jell-O, this can result in serious damage.

                --->
            </p>

            <p>
                Though more commonly caused by head trauma, a subarachnoid hemorrhage may also result from an aneurysm in the brain. Aneurysms—weakened areas on the walls of arteries—may be congenital (present at birth) or may appear later in life. Their rupture is sometimes the result of cocaine or amphetamine abuse. The symptoms of a hemorrhage in the brain include severe headache, vomiting, dizziness, seizures, blackouts, sleepiness, slurred speech, double vision, unequal pupil size, and/or mental confusion. Often only the severe headache is present, which may sometimes improve briefly, only to be followed by coma.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience the worst headache of your life, or a “thunderclap” headache (one that has maximal intensity at onset), call 911 or get someone to take you to an emergency room immediately. Do not take any aspirin for pain relief— since aspirin blocks the ability of the platelets to form a clot, you may end up bleeding more. If you call 911 or go to the emergency room, you need to make sure they know you are having “the worst headache of your life.” This way they will know that you need to be seen by a doctor right away. In addition, if a friend or family member complains of a new, severe headache and then becomes sleepy or difficult to awaken, it may also be a hemorrhage in the brain and a medical emergency.
            </p>

            <p>
                Early diagnosis is important because if left untreated, at least one in five people dies from this condition. Medication and/or surgery (which can include stopping the bleeding, preventing the re-bleeding, and/or decreasing the pressure within the brain by draining fluid and blood from the skull) increases the chances for survival.

            Brain tumors usually cause headaches that get progressively worse. These headaches will sometimes worsen in the middle of the night. Other signs, such as seizures, weakness, or loss of sensation in a part of the body, can also occur.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                One of the main characteristics of a brain tumor is growth. Your headaches will worsen as the tumor grows, so if you have been having the same type of headache for more than two years, you probably do not have a malignant brain tumor. If your headache seems to be worsening over time, look for other symptoms, such as weakness, visual changes, or loss of sensation in a part of the body. It’s important to catch these symptoms quickly: Malignant brain tumors usually enlarge to a deadly size within weeks or months (though this can take as long as two years).
            </p>

            <p>
                The brain sits in a clear fluid that also surrounds the spinal nerves, which descend from the brain down the back. In a healthy person with a normal sleeping schedule (asleep at night and awake during the day), spinal fluid pressure is usually highest in the brain and spinal canal in the middle of the night. Headaches caused by a brain tumor, which increases this pressure, will usually worsen at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience a headache that becomes progressively worse and/or seizures, or if your headaches are not responding to treatment, you need to get medical evaluation as soon as possible.

            A headache accompanied by a stiff neck and  fever is an indicator of a serious infection called meningitis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Meningitis is an often deadly infection of the lining of the brain, also called the meninges, and the spinal cord. While meningitis is not common, it can be contagious. Infants, young children, and the elderly are particularly susceptible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meningitis often starts like the flu, with high fever, body aches, an oversensitivity to light, and a headache. The telltale sign of meningitis, however, is a stiff neck. If your neck is stiff or if you find that you have difficulty touching your chin to your chest, particularly if you also have a fever and a headache, seek medical evaluation. Meningitis must be diagnosed early, because it is a rapidly advancing disease. Particularly with bacterial meningitis, death can occur as early as thirty-six to forty-eight hours from the onset of symptoms, so any delay in seeking treatment can result in a fatality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Be aware that elderly patients and babies may not exhibit a stiff neck. Many elderly patients with meningitis will only have a headache and a fever. They may also seem confused and/or tired. Babies suffering from meningitis will not be able to communicate about their symptoms and may only show nonspecific signs of illness. However, young babies may have a bulge in the soft spot on their skull. (See Tip 232 for advice on how to detect meningitis in babies.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Meningitis is often treatable with antibiotics. If you are exposed to someone diagnosed with meningitis, seek medical advice about preventive measures.

            If you have the symptoms of nausea (possibly with vomiting), headache, and fatigue, consider that you may have carbon monoxide poisoning, especially if you feel worse indoors and someone you live with is experiencing similar symptoms. Other possible symptoms include bright red gums and lips, cherry red skin, weakness, mental confusion, dilated pupils, and/or chest pain (particularly if you are elderly). It is crucial to evacuate the house or the car and seek medical treatment.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Poisoning from carbon monoxide inhalation is a leading cause of accidental death, despite public awareness of its dangers. It can occur very subtly because the gas is odorless and colorless, and there is no way of knowing that it is present until illness occurs. It does not take a lot of exposure to make you very sick—children will usually be affected first, but carbon monoxide poisoning can kill both adults and children quickly. Note: If you have pets, they will also become sick from excess exposure to the gas.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best way you can protect yourself against carbon monoxide poisoning is to be aware. Have a heat and air company test the air inside your home for carbon monoxide, and test the heating system for proper exhaust once a year. Do not use kerosene heaters, charcoal grills, or camp stoves without proper ventilation, and make sure not to leave your car running in an enclosed area. If you have any of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning while in your car, get the exhaust system checked and make sure there are no holes in the floorboard. If you have a boat with a motor, have the engine and exhaust system checked regularly. This is important, because dangerous levels of carbon monoxide can accumulate on a boat even when it’s docked at a pier, by a stone wall, or alongside another boat. Also, make sure that no one ever swims near the boat while the motor is running. Inexpensive carbon monoxide monitors, which are sold at most hardware or department stores, will sound an alarm when levels of carbon monoxide get too high. Consider installing one on each level of your home or boat.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you suspect that you are being exposed to high levels of CO, you can have your blood tested by a doctor for the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, which can confirm a diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. Note: This test may be inaccurate if you are a smoker, as levels of carboxyhemoglobin can be altered by exposure to tobacco smoke. Also, the level of carboxyhemoglobin will be lower if you have been away from the carbon monoxide for a lengthy period of time.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you develop any of the red light warning signals of carbon monoxide poisoning, get out of the enclosed area and into fresh air immediately. Go to an emergency room for evaluation and treatment.

            If you have tenderness over your temples and/or blurred vision when you have a headache, you may have a serious condition called temporal arteritis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Temporal arteritis is a disease (usually occurring in senior citizens) that irritates and inflames the walls of your temporal arteries, which run along the side of your head. This disease may cause headaches and scalp pain (often noticed when combing one’s hair), tenderness around the temples, visual disturbances, and sometimes cramping of the jaw muscles while chewing. If the inflammation of the arteries becomes severe enough, blockage of the arteries (a stroke) may occur. If the artery to one of your eyes is blocked, you may also experience blurry vision or even total vision loss.
            </p>

            <p>
                A stroke can be prevented if this condition is diagnosed and treated early. A few simple blood tests, including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and complete blood count (CBC), may help your doctor make this diagnosis. To be one hundred percent accurate, he or she may order a one-to two-inch biopsy of the temporal artery. While long-term treatment may be necessary to control the ailment, immediate treatment may prevent complications. The cause of the disease is unknown.

            It is possible for dizziness to suddenly become so severe as to render you nonfunctional and cause you to fall or—if you are driving—crash your vehicle. Nausea and vomiting may also occur.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Dizziness may take the form of light-headedness (see Tip 7), or it may make you feel like you are spinning on a carousel (vertigo). The balance system consists of multiple factors: To feel balanced, your inner-ear apparatus and cerebellum (the small area of the brain in the back of the skull responsible for coordination) need to be normally functioning (see Figure 1). A breakdown in any of these systems can make you feel dizzy, particularly when you change your body position. Inner-ear disease can be sporadic, with a sudden and quite severe onset.

            <p>
                If you are experiencing vertigo, you are at a higher risk for falls. Falls can lead to serious injuries, such as hip fractures, and if the attack occurs when you are driving, you could have a serious auto accident. Do not drive, and avoid climbing stairs alone until your problem has been stabilized by medical treatment. If you experience vertigo (with or without nausea and vomiting), you need medical evaluation as soon as possible.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            Passing out or nearly passing out, with the feeling of light-headedness when you sit up or try to stand, is often the result of a drop in blood pressure  (orthostatic  hypotension).  The potentially life-threatening causes of this condition include internal hemorrhage, serious heart irregularities, and severe dehydration. These symptoms can also occur as side effects of certain medications.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A constant and uninterrupted flow of blood is required by all of your body’s organs. The brain is the first organ to fail without nutrition and oxygen from the blood, so even a slight change in blood flow to the brain will produce symptoms such as dizziness or fainting.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you sit up from lying down or when you stand from a sitting position, your blood vessels and heart automatically adjust by narrowing the vessels below the heart and widening the vessels above the heart that supply the brain, assuring that there will be adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain. If there is not enough blood or fluid in your circulation because of bleeding or dehydration, these automatic adjustments will not provide adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain, and you will feel dizzy or faint.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to know, however, that there are a number of other potential causes for these symptoms—some as serious as heart irregularities, and others as innocuous as eating a large meal or using the bathroom (these latter examples are more common with frail older adults). Another important potential cause is medication—some medications, including water pills (diuretics), certain blood pressure pills, some drugs for psychiatric disorders, and medications for shrinking an enlarged prostate gland, can affect the blood vessels and heart such that they will not adjust properly to provide adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain. If you are experiencing this type of dizziness, and are on medication, talk to your doctor and make sure that your symptoms are not a side effect. If they are, your doctor may adjust or change your medication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Seek immediate medical evaluation when you begin to get dizzy or faint. If internal hemorrhage, dehydration, or heart irregularities are causing your symptoms, emergency therapy could save your life. If the cause is less serious, and it relates to diet, eating small meals more frequently may help. Regardless, it is important to resolve this situation; dizziness is particularly dangerous in senior citizens, who are more subject to serious injuries when they fall.

            There are unusual presentations of a heart attack, such as a painless heart attack. Awareness can save your life. You may experience any or a combination of the following: a very weak feeling, sudden dizziness, a feeling that your heart is pounding, shortness of breath, and/or a heavy sweat. You may have a feeling of impending  doom. Nausea and vomiting often accompany these symptoms.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A heart attack can occur without chest pain, pressure in the chest, or a feeling of indigestion (see Tip 92). A painless heart attack can be just as deadly, but much more difficult to diagnose.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience the above symptoms, you may be having a heart attack, especially if you have other cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, a smoking habit, or a family history of early death from a heart attack. Heart attacks without chest discomfort are more often seen among diabetics, women, and senior citizens.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether or not you exhibit the classical symptoms of a heart attack, a doctor can usually make the correct diagnosis with an EKG and “dye” (intravenous contrast) studies, examining the small blood vessels that nourish your heart. Blood tests for chemical changes in the heart muscle, special types of X-rays, and scans of the heart are also helpful. Early diagnosis of a heart attack is crucial since it’s possible that lifethreatening complications can be treated. In certain instances immediate therapy can prevent permanent heart damage.

            Some signs of low blood  sugar  (hypoglycemia) are weakness, a rapid heartbeat, dizziness, confusion, profuse sweating, “acting weird,”  black outs, seizures, and unconsciousness. An extreme drop in blood sugar can occur in diabetics, which can be fatal if left untreated. Drinking fruit juice  and putting sugar under the tongue can provide immediate relief for these symptoms, but emergency medical evaluation and  treatment  may  also be necessary.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Hypoglycemia means you have a low blood sugar level, numerically, in the forties or lower. At these levels you will often become weak, jitter, shake, sweat profusely, develop a rapid heart rate, sometimes act “weird” (this behavior is occasionally misdiagnosed as a manic episode of mental illness or as intoxication), become dizzy or faint, and/or have seizures followed by unconsciousness. The symptoms of hypoglycemia usually occur first thing in the morning or anytime when several hours have elapsed since your last meal. If left untreated, it can be fatal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep in mind that diabetes medication can actually drive the blood sugar so low that it causes these problems. Hypoglycemia usually occurs when diabetics take too much insulin or too many oral agents for their diabetes, or when they do not consume adequate amounts of appropriate foods.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fluctuations in blood sugar levels in diabetics can cause blurred vision due to high amounts of sugar pulling water from the lenses of the eyes. The hypoglycemic symptom of shakiness between meals (called reactive hypoglycemia) is also common in non-diabetics, particularly after consuming sugar-rich meals. Though hypoglycemia is more serious in diabetics, its symptoms can generally be improved in both of these cases by eating small, high protein, low carbohydrate meals more frequently.
            </p>

            <p>
                A rare cause of very low sugar levels in non-diabetics is a small hormone-producing tumor (insulinoma) in the pancreas, which overproduces insulin. Excess insulin then passes into the bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia. Most of these tumors are noncancerous and a complete cure can often be obtained by removing the tumor.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are on beta-blockers, the medications used to treat hypertension and glaucoma, keep in mind that they will occasionally blunt the warning signs that your sugars are getting too low. Some of the common beta-blockers are metoprolol, carvedilol, propranolol, atenolol, and timolol. If you are taking one of these medications, the only symptom of hypoglycemia you may experience is confusion or weakness.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Hypoglycemia is different from hyperglycemia, which refers to high blood sugar as opposed to low blood sugar. However, some of the symptoms are similar. The doctor can distinguish between the two by simply testing the blood for sugar levels. The typical symptoms of hyperglycemia are nausea and vomiting, increased thirst and urination, decreased appetite, and fatigue. It often occurs when a diabetic inappropriately stops their diet, medication, or exercise regimen. Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can ultimately be life-threatening if left untreated.
