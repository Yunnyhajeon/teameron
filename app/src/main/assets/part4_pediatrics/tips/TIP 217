            Constipation is a very common symptom in babies, and is often associated with dietary issues. Also, the bowel habits of babies are different from those of adults--babies can often go longer without a bowel movement. However, if your baby has suffered from chronic severe constipation since birth, which may have included problems with passing meconium (the dark sticky stools) at birth, he or she may have an abnormality in his/her nerve supply to the large bowel. This condition requires surgery to prevent bowel obstruction and life-threatening inflammation or perforation of the bowel. There are also other problems that may cause severe constipation, including a defective anus.
