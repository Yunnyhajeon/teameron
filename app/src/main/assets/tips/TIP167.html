            The sudden onset of severe back pain could be a compression fracture, which occurs when there is general weakness in the bones caused by a loss of bone density. It is more common in senior citizens and requires increased bed rest.

<p>
                Sudden agonizing back pain can be the result of a softening of the bones and a vertebral fracture. Weak bones are more susceptible to fractures and collapse.

                Osteoporosis (a loss of bone mass and softening of the bones) develops gradually and usually without symptoms. It often begins in older women after menopause, since the ovaries produce less estrogen, causing the bones to lose more calcium. All postmenopausal women should be evaluated for osteoporosis. Keep in mind, however, that it can also begin earlier in life, especially in patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and/or those who are taking steroids. It is more common in people who are small in size, are not physically active, are Caucasian or Asian, and who smoke. The early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis is an important preventative measure. Vitamin D and calcium supplements can often be very helpful if taken in the proper doses. (See Appendix C, page 384, for more about bone density screening.)

                Bones that bear weight, such as the vertebrae of the spine, are the first to experience a change from the softening, which is why older people tend to lose height. If a vertebra collapses in what is called a compression fracture, it can produce agonizing pain. Confinement to bed, often resulting from fractures of the spine, hips, and legs, is the enemy of senior citizens, as it may lead to an early death from blood clots or lung infections. Lying still creates an environment where blood is more stagnant and more likely to clot, so doctors often recommend that elder patients with fractures use a brace so that they can get out of bed and move around, rather than being sedentary.

                Ideally, seniors should attempt to avoid fractures in the first place. New treatment options are available to increase the thickness (mass) of the bones and thus strengthen them. This preventive therapy may be appropriate for those with osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency. However, the side effects and costs of the treatment must be considered before starting it. If you have osteoporosis, you should discuss the pros and cons of this therapy with your physician.
