                    If you observe anything that is occurring that isn’t right or appears questionable, “stop the line.”

                        Every hospital should have a “stop the line” policy that clearly states that when anyone observes an event involving the care of a patient that is, or appears to be, in error, they should immediately notify the floor nurse, who should “stop the line”.  This means that every activity involving that patient should stop until whatever is in question is resolved. Ask and make sure that this is a hospital policy. You and/or your advocates should use it when it’s necessary. For example, if a nurse brings in a medicine for you that appears to be different from what you have been taking, you should question the change. If the nurse then discovers a mistake has been made, he or she should “stop the line” to find out why. Maybe there is someone with the same name or a similar name on the hospital floor. In this case, the error could happen again if the necessary precautions are not taken. Make certain that if there is an actual error, its cause has been resolved. If possible, this should be done before care measures are resumed. In such a case, special identifiers should be put in place. For example, a note might be placed on the front of the chart and/or on the door of the room.
