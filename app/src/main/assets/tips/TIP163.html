            Everyone with hives (a rash that is widespread, raised, red, swollen, intensely itchy, and may look like giant mosquito bites) ought to have at least one medical evaluation, because hives can occur with  blood cancers.

                Hives are most commonly the result of a generalized allergic reaction to foods, pollen, or medication. Exposure to heat and cold, sunlight, stress, and infections can also influence the development of hives. The recurring nature of hives is the most frustrating feature. Once they appear, they may improve, only to pop out again a few days later, without any known re-exposure to the precipitating factor.

                Certain blood-borne and other cancers can cause hives, such as leukemia and cancer of the lymph system. Although this rarely occurs, it is advisable to check with your physician, who may do more extensive testing if he or she is suspicious that a serious condition is causing the hives (also see Tips 154, 169, and 170).
