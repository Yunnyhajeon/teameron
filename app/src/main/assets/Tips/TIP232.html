            The vast majority of fevers in children have benign causes (that is, they are not life-threatening). However, if, along with a fever, your child is also irritable, not drinking, and/or difficult to awaken, it may be a serious life-threating illness such as meningitis.

                A temperature taken rectally is thought by many doctors to give the most accurate measurement. Many doctors recommend taking a rectal temperature if the child is under two years of age, and especially if the child is under six months old. Missing an elevated temperature in a baby can have life-threatening consequences. Ideally, every parent should own a thermometer that can be used rectally and know how to use it safely (see Appendix D, page 393, for instructions on taking a rectal temperature and discussion of other types of thermometers).

                If your infant has the preceding symptoms, see a doctor immediately. (See the introduction to the pediatric section under Abnormal Temperature, page 261, to determine which levels of fever require immediate attention at various age groups.) Do not overwrap your baby, as this may raise his or her temperature further.

                One important potential cause of a high fever in babies is meningitis, which is an infection of the membranes covering the brain. The fever may actually be an important first clue of the disease. Though babies get meningitis more commonly than older kids or adults, the disease is harder to detect in them, because they are unable to communicate about their symptoms (such as a headache). Also, before the soft spot on top of your baby’s head is closed, they are less likely to show the classic physical signs of a stiff neck, although the soft spot on their head may bulge out. This is why it is crucial to watch out for the infant’s behavior; if he or she is not in a happy, playful state at least every few hours, and/or he or she exhibits the other symptoms listed above, it is very important to get your baby to the emergency room immediately. The doctor needs to determine whether the child has a life-threatening condition. Urgent treatment is essential.

               It is important to note, though, that babies without a fever can still have meningitis. Teenagers and young adults are also prone to getting meningitis.
