            Do you need to worry about medical errors when you’re sick in the hospital? The Institute of Medicine, a group of medical authorities monitoring quality of health care, says that you do. In 1999 this organization released a report revealing that 48,000 to 98,000 patients die each year from medical errors occurring in the nation’s hospitals. This announcement shocked health-care providers and patients, prompting a much closer look at the health-care delivery system. Patients, insurance companies, the government, and other groups demanded changes to decrease these errors.

            Additional investigation determined that the infrastructure of the health-care delivery system has not kept up with rapidly advancing medical technology. While the wonders of modern medicine have indeed reduced suffering and death, these same advances have made treatments more complex. Indeed, medical advancements have resulted in a dramatic increase in the variety and volume of interventions, such that there are greater odds for hospital staff to make mistakes. For example, if five physicians in the hospital are doing a procedure or treating an illness differently, the hospital staff must learn and remember how to do a task five different ways.

            Fortunately, death rates from errors in hospitals are declining because of innovative efforts by hospitals, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies to improve quality control. However, there is more work to be done. A major positive step is to improve patient education. An informed patient can take a more active role in maintaining the quality of his or her health care. Be pleasant, but don’t be shy about expressing your concerns.
