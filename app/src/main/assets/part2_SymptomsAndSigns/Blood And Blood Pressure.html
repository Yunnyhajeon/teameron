            Even a mild elevation in blood pressure can put you at risk of having a heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, or heart failure.

            <p>
                It is a common misconception that mild high blood pressure (hypertension) is not serious. Optimal blood pressure is 120 over 80 or less. If the upper number (the systolic blood pressure) is above 120 or the lower number (the diastolic blood pressure) is above 80, you are at a higher risk of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure than those with lower blood pressure. Just because your blood pressure has been normal your whole life doesn’t mean you should stop having it checked. As the arteries in your body stiffen with aging, the systolic blood pressure (the top one) will continue to increase and you may need to begin taking medications. Mild to moderate elevations do not usually cause noticeable symptoms, but they are still dangerous to your health. Hypertension is known as a “silent killer.” Slight elevations such as 140 over 90 are often ignored for months or years, which may cause damage to the heart, brain, or kidneys, eventually resulting in a stroke, kidney failure, heart attack, or heart failure at an early age.
            </p>

            <p>
                Any elevation should be monitored with repeated blood pressure recordings. You should be evaluated by a doctor to determine the most effective therapeutic approach for controlling your blood pressure. (See Appendix C, page 380, for more detailed information about blood pressure and preventive screenings.)

            Treatment of high cholesterol and other abnor- mal blood lipids (fats) is important, even if you are a senior citizen.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Elevated cholesterol and other blood fats can create fatty de- posits (plaques) that may block your arteries, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. These plaques can also create blockages in the blood vessels of the legs. Many people think that the time to diet and/or take medication to prevent this from happening is when you are young. Senior citizens often believe that the damage is done and there is nothing they can do about it. This defeatist attitude is absolutely wrong. The combination of lifestyle changes and cholesterol-lowering drugs can slow or stop the buildup of plaques and, in some cases, even reduce the amount of plaques that are already present. Microscopic photographs taken inside the arteries show that cholesterol deposits will sometimes even shrink with treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was originally thought that the gradual buildup of fats in an artery’s walls would totally block it, at which point no more blood would pass through the vessel. If the blood vessel was responsible for the nourishment of the heart, a heart attack would result, and if it was responsible for the nourishment of the brain, a stroke (with symptoms such as paralysis, speech loss, etc.) would result. But recent research indicates that the fat does not totally block the blood vessel, but only partially blocks it. Total blockage is actually caused by a chemical reaction at the site of the fatty deposit, which results in the formation of a blood clot. Therefore if you slow the formation of and/or shrink the fatty deposits, the likelihood of blood clotting diminishes, reducing the risk that you will have a heart attack or stroke. This is confirmed by the scientific find- ing that both young and old people live longer after lowering their cholesterol and other blood fat levels.

                The medications now used to treat these problems are very effective. Liver toxicity is a potential side effect, though, so your doctor should monitor your liver function with certain blood tests. Also, if you develop muscle pain or weakness while on these medications, you should discuss these new problems with your doctor.

            It’s always important to know why you have had blood clots (phlebitis). The cause may require long-term therapy. Also, it may be related to an undiagnosed disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. Ask your doctor if he/she can deter- mine the cause of your blood clots.
        </div>

                Phlebitis, or what doctors refer to as deep venous thrombosis, is when you have blood clots in the veins, most often in the legs. It is a true medical emergency and warrants immediate medical attention. However, when you get out of the hospital and all of the anxiety has subsided, you need to find out why you had phlebitis, so that repeat episodes can be prevented. Also, it needs to be determined if there is an urgent underlying problem that has to be addressed. Do not put it off.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process of blood clotting is a complex series of chemical reactions. There are a number of things that can go wrong, increasing the risk of dangerous blood clots. For example, it is possible for substances called abnormal antibodies to pro- mote excessive clotting of the blood. Though antibodies are made by the body’s immune system, these antibodies can do harm by causing the blood to clot inappropriately. Their presence can be determined by blood tests. If you have them, you are under a continual risk of another blood clot, and there is a need for prolonged anticoagulation (blood-thinning) therapy to prevent recurrence of the blood clots. You may also need long-term treatment if the reason you got the blood clot is heart failure or if your work involves long periods of sitting still, since either circumstance puts you at a much higher risk of developing future blood clots.
            </p>

            <p>
                More serious conditions can also lead to increased blood clotting. One of the possibilities is cancer—many types of cancer cause few or no symptoms and sometimes the only tip- off to their presence is an episode of phlebitis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Don’t let this happen to you. Ask your doctor why you had blood clots. (Also see Tip 139 for a full description of the symptoms of phlebitis and Tip 249 about preventive measures for anyone with phlebitis who is hospitalized for any reason. Also see Tips 62 to 64 and 81 for symptoms relating to blood clots in the lungs or leg.)

            The best method to control blood spurting from a blood vessel due to a severe laceration is to put direct pressure on the wound and pressure on another blood vessel between the wound and the heart. Some examples of good secondary pressure points are between the shoulder and elbow, the groin area, and behind the knee. This approach is better than using a tourniquet. Also, elevate the wound area above the heart if possible.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Very few things are more frightening than seeing blood spurting from a severed artery after a serious injury. The best way to reduce bleeding is to apply direct pressure. Gauze dressing is the ideal material to press against the wound, but if gauze is unavailable, any type of cloth will suffice. Continued compression will cause the artery to constrict, and clotting will follow. Even bleeding from a large artery can be controlled in this fashion until emergency care arrives.
            </p>

            <p>
                Do not attempt to wash the wound or remove any debris. If there is anything sticking out of the wound, wrap material and apply direct pressure around it. If it is a head injury, do not apply direct pressure, since there may be a skull fracture that can be made worse. Wrap material snugly around the head to cover the wound.
            </p>

            <p>
                Avoid the temptation to look under the bandage to see if the bleeding has stopped; you may break the clot and make the bleeding worse. Once direct pressure has been applied, leave the gauze in place until it is removed by a health professional. If it bleeds through, apply another cloth on top of the first one.
            </p>

            <p>
                If too much blood is lost, an individual may go into shock (this condition is characterized by a sudden drop in blood pressure, cold/clammy skin, paleness, etc.). If this happens:
             </p>
             
                <ul>
                    <li>Call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
                    <li>Lay the victim on his/her back and elevate the legs. However, if you suspect a neck injury, DO NOT move the victim.</li>
                    <li>If he/she stops breathing, begin CPR (see Appendix A, for CPR guidelines).</li>
                    <li>Keep the victim warm.</li>
                </ul>
           

            <p>
                If you are assisting an injured person, avoid contaminating your eyes, mouth, or an open wound with their blood. Wear gloves when available and wash yourself well for fifteen minutes as soon as possible.

            It is important to have the right level of potassium in your blood. Both low and high potassium levels can make you feel very weak and cause muscle cramps. In more serious cases, either condition can lead to a fatal heart rhythm problem.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Potassium is a mineral found in a wide variety of foods, such as bananas, tomatoes, and orange juice. You can usually get enough of the potassium your body needs from the foods you eat.
            </p>

            <p>
                Potassium moves in and out of muscle cells, creating the electrical currents that make your muscles move. This is true for all muscles in your body, including those in your arms, legs, and torso. Low potassium levels in your body can cause profound muscle weakness, spasms, and cramps. The heart is the most important muscle that depends upon potassium. When potassium levels become too low or too high, abnormal electrical currents will travel throughout the heart. The sudden discharge of these abnormal currents can cause it to pump irregularly, which may lead to a sustained heart spasm, followed by death.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can lose potassium when vomiting or having diarrhea. This loss is normally replaced through ingested foods and beverages, but long periods of vomiting and diarrhea can result in dangerously low potassium levels, which can be checked with a simple blood test. Taking potassium pills or liquids may be necessary to avoid a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm.
            </p>

            <p>
                High blood pressure can be associated with low potassium levels. Most water pills (or diuretics) used to treat high blood pressure, swelling, and heart failure can cause you to lose extra potassium in your urine. If you are taking a diuretic for any reason, you should have your blood potassium level checked by your doctor on a regular basis. Depending on your potassium level, it may be important for you to take supplemental potassium pills or liquids.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another rare cause of profound potassium loss can be an overactive adrenal gland (located on top of each kidney), which causes high blood pressure. This condition requires a special medication or the surgical removal of part of the gland to maintain a normal potassium level.
            </p>

            <p>
                On the other hand, very high potassium levels can cause heart-pumping irregularities, associated with certain medications, including the blood pressure pill known as an ACE inhibitor. These high potassium levels can also be caused by kidney disease. You should not take extra potassium pills without having your blood potassium levels monitored by your doctor.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, if you experience muscle weakness and/or cramps, especially after diarrhea; are vomiting, taking water pills, taking potassium supplements, or taking the category of blood pressure pills called ACE inhibitors; or if you have a history of kidney disease, you should tell your doctor so he or she can monitor your potassium level. Note: There are many other possible causes of muscle cramps.
