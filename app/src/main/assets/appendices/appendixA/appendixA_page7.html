                <b>Step 1:</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                            <li>Get somebody to call 911.</li>
                            <li>If alone:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For an adult, call 911, then begin CPR.</li>
                                <li>For a child or infant, perform 2 minutes or about 5 cycles of CPR, then call 911.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                        </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 2: There are two choices:</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choice 1: Give 2 rescue breaths (in about 2 seconds).</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Then give cycles of 30 compressions (in about 15 seconds): 2 breaths (in about 2 seconds).</li>
                            <li>Continue to alternate between compressions and breaths.</li>
                        </ul>
                            
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Choice 2: Give compressions only (100 per minute).</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you don’t feel comfortable giving breaths, compressions alone could still save somebody’s life.</li>
                            <li>Note: Breaths along with compressions are much more important for children and infants.</li>
                        </ul>
                            
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Step 3:</b> If there is an AED (automated external defibrillator) available, attach it as soon as possible and follow the automated directions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: AEDs are not recommended for infants.</li>
                    <li>Remember: <b>Time is of the essence.</b> Never delay or pause more than 10 seconds when giving CPR. The ideal is to continue CPR until you revive the person or someone of equal or higher training takes over.</li>
                </ul>
