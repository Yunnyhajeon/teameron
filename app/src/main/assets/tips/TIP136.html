            Painful menstruation and PMS are not serious disorders, but some of the drugs used to treat them can have life-threatening, addictive effects.

                Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a cycle of symptoms that may include a combination of the following: headache, breast swelling, bloating, and emotional symptoms. It usually begins sometime within two weeks of a menstrual period and it may continue throughout the period and up until a few days afterward. Menstrual pain appears to be caused by specific hormones called prostaglandins, which alter the muscle walls of the womb and its blood vessels. Specific over-the-counter medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), including ibuprofen and Naproxen, stop the production of these prostaglandin hormones. Starting the medicine at the appropriate dosage a few days before your period is often very effective treatment for the pain. Your doctor may decide to prescribe a diuretic (water pill), an antidepressant, and/or hormones to treat the various symptoms of PMS, which include bloating, mood swings, and cramping. Exercise, diet modifications, and stress reduction techniques can also improve PMS symptoms.

                Though you may be tempted to treat your symptoms with tranquilizers or narcotics, keep in mind that taking these on a regular basis is potentially addictive and can have a serious negative impact on your mental and physical well-being. Also, narcotics are not an effective way to treat either PMS symptoms or menstrual cramps because they do not affect the production of the prostaglandin hormones that are responsible for these symptoms.
