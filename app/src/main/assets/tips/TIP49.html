            Smokers sometimes develop slow-healing sores on their fingertips, around their fingernails, or on their toes. These sores may indicate that a serious disease is blocking their arteries.

                If you smoke and have sores on your fingertips or toes, you need to stop immediately. These sores may occur in one digit only. They will intermittently blanch white, are often painful, and are intolerant to the cold. The disease causing this red light warning signal is thromboangiitis obliterans (Buergerâ€™s disease).

                This disorder can cause the blood vessels to narrow, impairing circulation and thus damaging the fingers and toes. This damage can be so severe that it leads to gangrene, which may ultimately require amputation of the arm and/or leg. Alternatively, dangerous blood clots could form in these narrowed blood vessels, potentially leading to fatal complications. Another common blood vessel problem caused by smoking is a decrease in blood flow to the sexual organs, which can lead to impotence.

                If you notice that you have these symptoms, seek medical advice as soon as possible, and stop smoking.
