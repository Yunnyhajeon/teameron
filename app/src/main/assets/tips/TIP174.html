            Treatment of high cholesterol and other abnor- mal blood lipids (fats) is important, even if you are a senior citizen.

                Elevated cholesterol and other blood fats can create fatty de- posits (plaques) that may block your arteries, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. These plaques can also create blockages in the blood vessels of the legs. Many people think that the time to diet and/or take medication to prevent this from happening is when you are young. Senior citizens often believe that the damage is done and there is nothing they can do about it. This defeatist attitude is absolutely wrong. The combination of lifestyle changes and cholesterol-lowering drugs can slow or stop the buildup of plaques and, in some cases, even reduce the amount of plaques that are already present. Microscopic photographs taken inside the arteries show that cholesterol deposits will sometimes even shrink with treatment.

                It was originally thought that the gradual buildup of fats in an arteryâ€™s walls would totally block it, at which point no more blood would pass through the vessel. If the blood vessel was responsible for the nourishment of the heart, a heart attack would result, and if it was responsible for the nourishment of the brain, a stroke (with symptoms such as paralysis, speech loss, etc.) would result. But recent research indicates that the fat does not totally block the blood vessel, but only partially blocks it. Total blockage is actually caused by a chemical reaction at the site of the fatty deposit, which results in the formation of a blood clot. Therefore if you slow the formation of and/or shrink the fatty deposits, the likelihood of blood clotting diminishes, reducing the risk that you will have a heart attack or stroke. This is confirmed by the scientific find- ing that both young and old people live longer after lowering their cholesterol and other blood fat levels.

                The medications now used to treat these problems are very effective. Liver toxicity is a potential side effect, though, so your doctor should monitor your liver function with certain blood tests. Also, if you develop muscle pain or weakness while on these medications, you should discuss these new problems with your doctor.
