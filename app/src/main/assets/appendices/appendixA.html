            Courses on how to respond to the following emergencies are available through the American Red Cross, American Heart Association, or local hospitals. It is advisable to take these courses for in-depth training so that you can be better prepared for emergency situations. Also, remember to ask someone to call for emergency help (911, etc.) while you are attempting to administer care.

            <h3>Choking</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            Choking often happens because something is obstructing the airway. The choking person may have a sudden onset of coughing and redness, or he or she may suddenly turn blue in color and be unable to cough or speak.
        </p>
            <p><b>Partial Airway Obstruction</b></p>
        <p>
            If the choking person is still able to cough and/or speak, stay with them and encourage them to continue coughing. Pay close attention and be prepared to act when needed.
        </p>
            <p><b>Full Airway Obstruction</b></p>
        <p>
            If the choking person is unable to cough or speak, you need to act rapidly before they become limp and pale.
        </p>
            <p><b>How to Help If the Person Is Above the Age of One and Conscious—Abdominal Thrusts, i.e., the Heimlich Maneuver</b></p>
        
        <p>    
            <ul>
		        <li><b>Position:</b> Kneel or stand behind the child or adult with your arms joined firmly against his or her upper abdomen in the center, between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage (see Figure 17). If the person is alert and conscious, explain gently what you are about to do.</li>
		        <li><b>Action:</b> Give up to five rapid, firm, upward thrusts until the object dislodges and the individual begins to breathe. Try to avoid pulling on the ribs.</li>
		        <li><b>If no success:</b> If the victim is still conscious, repeat the maneuver. If he or she becomes unconscious, begin CPR. (See the following guidelines for CPR.)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <p><b>IN THE CASE OF PREGNANCY OR OBESITY</b></p>
			In pregnant or obese persons, you may need to place your hands or arms at the location of the chest, that is, the center of the breastbone, instead of below the rib cage. If you are unable to get your arms around the person from behind, you can have them put their back against a wall, and you can provide the thrusts directly to the front of the chest. Give up to five rapid, firm chest thrusts—either from behind or from the front.
        </p>

        <p>
            <p><b>IF YOU ARE ALONE AND CHOKING</b></p>
			Find a hard, blunt edge (for example, the back of a chair or the edge of a countertop), and drop yourself onto it, so that the edge strikes you between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage. Repeat the action until the object is dislodged.
        </p>

        <p>
			Pick up a telephone (if available) and dial 911. A regular landline telephone is better than a cell phone; in most cases, emergency services will be able to track your location from the call, even if you are unable to speak. If you must use a cell phone, be sure to give them your exact location immediately if you are still able to speak.

            <p><b>How to Help an Infant Under the Age of One:</b></p>
            <i>Note: If it is a child with croup, suspected epiglottitis, or asthma (see Tips 210 and 211), do not undertake these procedures unless he/she cannot utter a sound and is clearly choking.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>IN THE CASE OF A CONSCIOUS  INFANT</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Position:</b> Place the infant face down on your arm, with the child’s head and neck below his/her trunk (e.g., on your knee). Support his or her neck and head with one hand.</li>
                <li><b>Action:</b> Using the heel of your other hand, give him/her approximately five firm, quick blows between the shoulder blades, forcefully enough to expel the object. The object should come out.</li>
                <li><b>If no success:</b> Turn the infant face up on your lap or on a firm surface, and support his/her head and neck with one hand. Use two fingers of your other hand to thrust inward and upward five times in the center of the breastbone, one finger-width below the nipple line. Watch the mouth, and remove the offending object with your pinky finger as soon as it appears.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Continue the above maneuvers (five back blows, five chest thrusts) until one of two things happens: the object is expelled and the infant begins to cry, or the infant becomes unconscious or unresponsive.
        </p>

        <p>    
            <ul>
                <li><b>If still no success:</b> Call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
                <li><b>Position:</b> Turn the infant faceup on a hard surface (tabletop, counter, or floor).</li>
                <li><b>Action:</b> Look in the mouth for any object on which the infant could be choking. If you see anything, use your pinky finger to remove the object. Do not blindly sweep fingers into the infant’s mouth.</li>
                <li>If you are unable to see anything, open the airway by tilting the head back very slightly (if at all), put your mouth over the baby’s nose and mouth, and give 2 gentle breaths (puffs of air, using only the amount of air you can hold in your cheeks).</li>
                <li>Watch to see if the chest rises and falls. </li>
                <li>If the chest does not rise and fall, the airway may still be blocked. Immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two attempted breaths. (See the following guidelines on CPR.) Check the mouth for the object each time you are about to provide a breath. Do not reach into the infant’s mouth unless you see an object to remove. </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the chest does rise and fall, stop and reassess whether the infant has begun breathing. Keep the infant’s airway open with a slight tilt and look toward the chest for chest rise, feel for breath on your cheek, and listen for sounds of breathing. If the infant is not breathing on his or her own, immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two breaths. (See the following CPR guidelines.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>*Special note:</b> Remember when alone with a child or infant it is always best to initiate two minutes of care before calling 911. If there are any bystanders, have them contact 911 while you begin care.
            </p>
            
            <p>
               <p><b>Choking Prevention in Children</b></p>
				The best way to save a child from choking is to avoid it altogether. In general, children under three years old are the most at risk. Within this age range, children between nine months and two years are particularly prone to choking. At this stage, they are increasingly mobile and very likely to put items in their mouth, but are not yet responsive to your commands. Supervise your child well, and keep small items out of reach. Check under furniture and between cushions for small items (such as pen/marker caps, thumbtacks, etc.) that children could find and put in their mouths. Also supervise the actions of older children (such as siblings) who may give a younger child an object that poses a choking threat.
 
            </p>

            <p>When choosing playthings for small children, be sure to follow the age recommendations on the toy packages. Also, think carefully before giving your child certain foods, and supervise infants and young children at mealtime. Do not allow them to run, play, or lie down with food in their mouths.</p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Toys and Household Objects with Particular Risks</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Balloons:</b> Balloons are the most common cause of fatalities from choking. Always supervise children under the age of six when playing with balloons. Use Mylar, not latex, balloons, and make sure to dispose of broken pieces of balloons immediately. Note: Balloons pose a choking risk to children of any age.</li>
                    </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Small items:</b> Avoid giving a child any item that can fit entirely into his or her mouth or with small (under two inches) parts. This includes coins, small balls, marbles, beads, medicine syringes, and toy food. If it can fit through the opening of a toilet paper roll, it is too small for a young child.</li>
                    <li><b>Small batteries:</b> These are especially dangerous, as sometimes the acid can seriously damage the stomach lining.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p><b>Foods with Particular Risks</b></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nuts, seeds, or popcorn:</b> These are the most commonly inhaled foods. Do not give these to an infant or young child.</li>
                    <li><b>Firm fruits or vegetables:</b> Prepare carrots, grapes, apples, pears, and celery appropriately: Peel them, chop them finely, or cook them until soft.</li>
                    <li><b>Sausages:</b> It’s safest not to give sausages to children under six years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Hot dogs:</b> It’s safest not to give hot dogs to children under six years old.</li>
                    <li><b>Chunks of meat, cheese, or peanut butter:</b> Shred or grate any firm cheeses. Spread soft cheese or peanut butter on a cracker or piece of bread. Grind, crumble, or shred meat into small bits before serving to an infant or young child.</li>
                    <li><b>Raisins, prunes, or apricots:</b> Boil any dried fruits so they become soft and easily chewed. Prunes and apricots need to also be cut into smaller pieces.</li>
                    <li><b>Hard, gooey, or sticky candy:</b> Do not give hard candy to children under the age of three.</li>
                    <li><b>Chewing gum:</b> Avoid giving gum to young children.</li>
                    <li><b>Marshmallows:</b> Do not let children play any games where they try to fit as many large marshmallows in their mouth as possible. When a marshmallow is pulled into the airway, it becomes moist and sticky, and then expands.</li>
                </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Then give cycles of 30 compressions (in about 15 seconds): 2 breaths (in about 2 seconds).</li>
                            <li>Continue to alternate between compressions and breaths.</li>

            <p>
                <b>Overview</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Any infant, child, or adult whose breathing or heartbeat stops will rapidly experience damage to his or her vital organs, especially the brain. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) allows oxygen to reach the vital organs until expert help can be given in a hospital. This is a critical skill for you to learn. In this section, we provide you with general CPR guidelines. Of course, attending a CPR training course is the best way to learn; a written summary can give you only an outline.

                However, even if you have not had CPR training, do not let this prevent you from acting in an emergency situation. If you don’t try, the person’s going to die. In fact, the American Heart Association is now encouraging a “Hands-Only” approach for untrained lay people who have any hesitation about performing CPR. In the past, many people who needed CPR have died as a result of bystanders not stepping in to help for fear of acting incorrectly or because they hesitated to breathe into the mouth of a stranger. While many doctors think that the very best option is to do compressions in combination with breaths, doing compressions alone is much better than doing nothing. If you don’t feel comfortable giving breaths for any reason, then just do compressions. However, it is always very important, if at all possible, to give breaths along with compressions to children and infants.

            </p>

            <p>
				CPR training now includes instruction relating to the use of an AED (automated external defibrillator).This is a laptop-size device that analyzes the rhythm of the heart for abnormalities and gives an electrical shock, if necessary, to the victim. Though often considered inaccessible, AEDs can be found in a surprising number of public places, such as airports, parks and recreation facilities, government and corporate facilities, and schools. Start asking people, start looking for them, so that you’ll be able to find one in an emergency situation. Using an AED is easy even for laypeople with no prior training.
            </p>
            
            <p>
				There are many reasons a person can end up in a situation where he or she is unconscious, unresponsive, and not breathing, but regardless of the cause, they need CPR. Whether someone is drowning, choking, struck by lightning, having a stroke or heart attack, or suffering sudden cardiac arrest, if he or she ends up unconscious, unresponsive, and not breathing, then time is of the essence. Call 911 and begin CPR immediately. Also use an AED if readily available, or ideally get the help of a bystander to assist with the AED.
            </p>

            <p><b>Important Facts to Consider:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every minute that care is not given, the chance of survival decreases by about 10 percent.</li>
                    <li>After someone goes five to seven minutes without oxygen, brain damage usually occurs.</li>
                    <li>After ten to twelve minutes without oxygen, there is usually irreversible brain damage.</li>
                    <li>Even compressions alone are better than doing nothing, and may help the victim if you are unable or unwilling to provide breaths.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            	<ul>
        			<li>Most studies we reviewed suggested that the chest compressions are the most important part of CPR. However, breaths in combination with compressions are very important for children and infants.</li>
        			<li>Try to do your best to follow the recommended CPR guidelines. However, the most important thing is to dive in and start CPR, even if you are unsure. If you don’t try, the person’s going to die.</li>
   				</ul>
			</p>

   			<p>
       			Remember: <b>Time is of the essence.</b> Never delay or pause more than ten seconds when giving CPR. The ideal is to continue CPR until you revive the person or someone of equal or higher training takes over.

                <b>Preparing for CPR</b>
                Do not move the person unless necessary, especially if you suspect a neck or spinal injury. If you must move the person and they are unresponsive, position them on their back, ideally on a hard, flat surface. Turn the victim’s entire body at once—head, shoulders, back, hips, and legs—in the same direction (log roll them) to protect the neck and prevent possible additional injuries. Avoid twisting the back. (Note: This is more easily done with two people.)
            </p>

            <p><b>A = Airway</b></p>

            <p>
                HEAD TILT–CHIN LIFT
				Place a hand on the forehead and two fingers on the chin. Open the airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin (in order to extend the neck). Make sure there are no objects in the mouth, but clear the mouth only if you see something. For children and infants: You still need to open the airway, but do not bend the neck too far—because this will actually close the airway.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>B = Breathing</b>
            </p>

            <p>
            	Check for breathing by leaning down
				and placing your ear and cheek just above the victim’s mouth. Look toward the victim’s chest, listen and feel for breaths (5–10 seconds).
			</p>

			<p>
				If the victim is not breathing, prepare to begin breathing for them, following the guidelines below.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note: Blowing too hard or too long into any age victim can force air into the stomach and cause vomiting. 
			</p>

			<p>
				However, vomiting is a reflex; it does not mean that the victim is breathing or has a heartbeat. If vomiting occurs, roll the victim onto their side, help clear out the mouth, roll them back over, and continue providing CPR.
			</p>

			<p>
				1. Check to make sure that there are no objects in the mouth. Clear the mouth only if you see an object.
				2. Position your mouth to give breaths to the victim. The proper positioning of your mouth when giving breaths to adults, children, and infants are as follows:
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
    				<li>Adults (> 8 yrs of age): Pinch the victim’s nose with your fingers and make a seal around their mouth with your mouth.</li>
    				<li>Children (1–8 yrs of age or < 55 pounds): Pinch the victim’s nose with your fingers and make a seal around their mouth with your mouth.</li>
    				<li>Infants (<1 year of age): Make a seal with your mouth around both the mouth and the nose of the infant.</li>
    				<li>Give two <b>slow</b> and steady breaths, for about one second each, lifting your mouth from the victim’s after each breath to let them exhale. Watch to be certain that the chest visibly rises when you provide each breath.</li>
    				<li>If the chest does not visibly rise, continue trying to give the victim breaths until the chest does rise (re-tilting the head to open the airway before each try).</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				<ul>
                	<li>If the victim does not begin breathing on their own after two successful breaths, prepare to follow with chest compressions.</li>
            	</ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>C = Compressions</b>    
            </p>

            <p>
                Compress the chest 30 times, HARD and FAST at a rate of 100 beats/ minute, following the guidelines below for adults, children, and infants:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adults (>8 yrs old or >55 lbs): Place the heel of one hand on top of the other with your fingers pointing along the direction of the ribs. Use two hands to push firmly two inches deep on the center of the chest (the sternum) at the nipple line. Allow the chest to recoil between each compression.</li>
                    <li>Children (1–8 yrs of age): Positioning is the same as an adult, but depending on your size and the size of the child, you may not need the extra force of the second hand over the first. With one or two hands, push on the center of the chest at the nipple line 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch deep. Allow the chest to recoil between  each compression.</li>
                    <li>Infants (<1 year of age): Since an infant is much smaller than an adult, your actions will be adjusted accordingly. Place the tips of your two fingers in the middle of the breastbone, one finger-width below the nipple line. With two fingers, push on the chest 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch deep. Allow the chest to recoil between each compression.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If the victim does not begin to breathe on their own after 30 compressions, then continue to repeat the CPR cycle, alternating between 30 compressions and 2 breaths.
            </p>
			
			<p>
				*Do not be surprised if you feel popping or cracking under your hands when you are providing good, hard, and fast compressions to someone’s chest. This is normal and they will heal from this in the hospital. Continue providing the good, hard, and fast compressions; they are crucial to keep moving the blood and oxygen around the body to keep the victim’s vital organs oxygenated.
			</p>

			<p>
				*Some experts in CPR training suggest that the rate of compressions is approximately the beat of the Bee Gees song “Stayin’ Alive.” Humming this melody to yourself may help make it easier to do compressions at the proper rate.

            <p><b>D = Defibrillation</b></p>

            <p>
                AEDs are to be used on adults and children over 1 year of age. The AED should not be used on an infant younger than 1 year of age. Note: If an AED is put on someone who does not need to be shocked, then it will not shock.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>You cannot hurt someone with an AED!</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The purpose of an AED is to analyze the heartbeat of the victim and shock the heart if needed.</li>
                    <li>All AEDs look different; they come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but as long as you can get your hands on the AED and turn it on, you will be able to figure it out. All AEDs have some type of voice or visual prompts.</li>
                    <li>Once the AED arrives, bare the chest of the victim and turn the machine on. Do not stop providing CPR until the AED is in position and turned on.</li>
                    <li>Follow the voice and/or visual prompts to attach the pads and begin analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Positioning of AED pads:</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                For adults, place one pad high on the right side of the chest and the other on the back at the same level. If unable to move the victim, place one pad on the right side of the chest and the other low on the left over the ribs. For children, one pad should be placed on the front of the chest, and the other on the back. The purpose of each of these positionings is to sandwich the heart in between the pads.
            </p>

            <p>
                The following are directions for special circumstances when placing the AED pads:
                 <ul>
                    <li>Hairy chest—Use the razor in the pouch attached to the AED to shave the area, and then apply the pads.</li>
                    <li>Water—If the victim is lying in water, move them out of the water.</li>
                    <li>Use a towel or whatever you have available to quickly dry the chest, then apply the pads.</li>
                    <li>Implanted device—A lump will be under the skin on the left or right side of the chest. If the device is on the right side (which is where one of the pads should be placed), place the pad one inch from the device and not directly on top of the device.</li>
                    <li>Medication patches—If there is a patch on the victim’s chest, remove it and wipe the area quickly before you place the pads on the chest.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
               The AED will make one of two decisions once it is attached: 
           	</p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Shock advised:</b> In this case, stand clear to allow the machine to provide a shock. Once the shock is provided, the machine will prompt when it is safe to touch the victim. Do not turn off the machine or remove the pads. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. If there’s no breath, open the airway (by lifting the chin and tilting the head back) and proceed with two minutes of CPR (5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). Always begin with compressions.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Shock not advised:</b> The machine will prompt you to return to the victim. Do not turn off the machine or remove the pads. Immediately open the airway (by lifting the chin and tilting the head back), and proceed with two minutes of CPR (5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). Always begin with compressions.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                After two minutes, the AED will analyze and decide again whether it should shock or not. Usually when an AED is used, a normal heartbeat may restart after the first or second shock, but sometimes more shocks may be required.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The AED will continue cycling through analyzing, shocking—if needed—and then allowing two minutes to provide CPR. Continue to follow the prompts until emergency medical professionals arrive.

                When you are alone with a person who stops breathing and they are in need of CPR and an AED, there are a few things to consider:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adult: Immediately CALL 911 and get the AED if it is readily available. Give 2 initial rescue breaths, then begin to provide CPR (alternating between 30 compressions: 2 breaths) and use the AED.  *Remember: The chance of survival decreases by 10 percent for every minute you delay starting CPR.</li>
                        <li>Child: Immediately give 2 initial rescue breaths, then begin CPR. Provide TWO MINUTES of CPR (about 5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). If the child is not responding to the CPR, call 911 and get the AED (if readily available).</li>
                        <li>Then continue CPR, and use the AED.  *Remember: The chance of survival decreases the longer there is a lapse in giving CPR.</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
            	<ul>
                	<li>Infant: Immediately give 2 initial rescue breaths, then begin CPR. Provide TWO MINUTES of CPR (about 5 cycles of 30 compressions: 2 breaths). If the infant is not responding to the CPR, call 911. Then continue CPR. *Remember: The chance of survival decreases the longer there is a lapse in giving CPR.</li>
            	</ul>

                    <li>The victim begins breathing on his/her own.</li>
                    <li>A person of equal or higher training arrives to help.</li>
                    <li>Emergency medical professionals arrive to take over.</li>
                    <li>You, the rescuer, are physically exhausted and can no longer continue.</li>
                    <li>The scene becomes dangerous and you, the rescuer, are now in danger.</li>

                In the United States of America, in most cases the Good Samaritan law covers any individual who attempts to help a person in need. There are four main points to keep in mind when you step in to help:
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must be reasonably careful and not purposely try to hurt someone.</li>
                    <li>Act in “good faith.” You cannot be paid or rewarded for your service.</li>
                    <li>Do not try to provide care beyond your skill level.</li>
                    <li>Once you have begun to help, you are expected to stay with the victim and continue providing aid until someone of equal or higher training takes over, unless the scene or situation becomes dangerous for you.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

			</p>

			<p>
				Assess: Assess the situation and call 911 for help.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Airway: Open the airway. 
			</p>
