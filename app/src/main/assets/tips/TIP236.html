            Teenagers, in particular, are more likely to abuse substances (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, inhalants, ecstasy, methamphetamine, GHB, crystal meth, etc.). Inhaled substances such as adhesives, aerosols, solvents, and cleaning agents are especially dangerous, as they can cause brain, liver, and kidney damage, and sometimes even sudden death

                Substance abuse is more common in adolescent boys than girls. Tobacco is addictive and often causes death in later years, while alcohol is a major killer of both teenagers and adults. Inhalant use is prevalent among younger teens, and even in prepubescent kids. Inhalant abuse may be harder to detect in your child, because the “high” is only momentary and inhaled substances are found in every setting (homes, schools, stores, the workplace, etc.). The excessive use of household or office products that come in a spray can may be a tip-off that someone has an inhalant abuse problem. These might include products such as glues, spray paint, air fresheners, lighter fluid, oven cleaner, Dust-Off, or even dessert topping sprays. This is serious; even experimenting with inhalants can result in serious long-term physical or psychological problems, or even death.

                Watch out for changes in personality, mood, sleeping patterns, and/or appetite. Attempt to verify the facts, and contact self-help groups for advice. If you are unsure of whether your child is taking drugs, get professional help quickly. Lead your children by positive example, and spend time with them so that they will trust you and know that you accept them. A comprehensive resource is the National Institute on Drug Abuse  website: www.drugabuse.gov.
