            A combination of signs may be associated with Kawasaki's disease in a young, very irritable child. These include fever, red eyes, a redder-than-normal mouth, a rash, and/or enlarged neck glands. Signs may also include swelling and red and/or peeling skin on the hands and feet. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to prevent life-threatening heart problems.

                Your child may have Kawasaki’s if he or she is under five and has a high fever (over 104 degrees Fahrenheit) that lasts for several days, accompanied by the following symptoms (doctors expect to observe at least four of these):
                <ul>
<li>Light sensitivity and red eyes</li>
<li>Mouth and lips that are redder than normal (the surface of the tongue may look like a strawberry)</li>
<li>Changes in the hands and feet (initially swollen, then red and peeling)</li>
<li>Rash</li>
<li>Swollen glands in the neck</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                Kawasaki’s disease may initially resemble many other child-hood illnesses, but it is important to make the diagnosis and treat this condition as early as possible. Expert assessment is needed. Treatment for Kawasaki’s usually includes gamma-globulin and low-dose aspirin to prevent the formation of aneurysms (outpouchings) in the arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle, which may cause a “heart attack” in young children.

                See your doctor as soon as possible. Early treatment, including intravenous gamma-globulin and low-dose aspirin, can decrease the risk of life-threatening heart damage.
