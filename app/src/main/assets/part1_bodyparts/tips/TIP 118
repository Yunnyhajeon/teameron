            Any woman, particularly a postmenopausal older woman, who experiences redness, itching, white patches, and/or an ulcer that does not heal in or near the genitals, should seek medical evaluation. Cancer is one possible cause of these symptoms. Cancer in this region may not appear as a growth, but as an irritated or ulcerated area.
