            Epiglottitis can block your airway. If you are gasping with a “seal-like” noise, often associated with   a severe sore throat, you need to be seen by a doctor on an emergency basis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Epiglottitis is an infection of the epiglottis (the flap over the windpipe that stops food from getting into the lungs when you swallow). It causes the epiglottis to swell, blocking the airway. An important warning sign of a potential life-threatening case of epiglottitis is drooling and/or the presence of noisy breathing.
            </p>

            <p>
                When your condition gets much worse, there are depressed areas at the neck base, just above the breastbone, and in the spaces between the ribs. If these areas are noticeably sucked in when you inhale, it is possible that negative pressure in the chest cavity is being created by a significant blockage of the airway.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are experiencing noisy breathing or are struggling to inhale, you may be having difficulty getting air into your lungs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Call for an ambulance (911 in most locations). You need emergency care. (See Tip 210 for information on epiglottitis in babies and children.)

            Persistent hoarseness for more than three weeks may be caused by cancer of the vocal cords or another serious illness. Seek medical evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat specialist as soon as possible.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Your voice is generated by the vibrations of your vocal cords, which are located in the area of the throat called the larynx (a structure in the upper part of the breathing tube). Changes in the vocal cords can cause hoarseness. Think of a vocal cord as a guitar string—the thicker the string, the lower the pitch. As the cord swells, the pitch of your voice will become increasingly lower, until it becomes nothing more than a whisper.
            </p>

            <p>
                The two most common causes of hoarseness of the vocal cords are irritation from infection and swelling from excessive voice use. These conditions usually go away after a few days. Allergies and acid reflux from the stomach can also contribute to hoarseness. In the case of allergies, this can cause the hoarseness to come and go with the seasons.
            </p>

            <p>
                Persistent hoarseness (lasting for more than three weeks), however, may be a tip-off to throat cancer, which causes permanent thickening of a vocal cord. This occurs more commonly in smokers and probably in people with chronic acid reflux from the stomach. A cure is possible with early diagnosis and treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Persistent hoarseness can also result from the routine occurrence of fluid entering the lungs when the liquids you drink go up your nose as you swallow. This condition may be indicative of a nerve or muscle disorder, a stroke, or a tumor.

            If food or drink will not go down when you swallow, or swallowing causes you pain, you may have a partial esophagus obstruction that could lead to or be a sign of cancer.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Difficulty swallowing is a common problem. Most of the time it occurs when eating bulky foods like meat or corn bread. You swallow, and it sticks at a narrowed part of the esophagus (the swallowing tube that extends from mouth to stomach) before finally going down. You feel the food getting stuck in a region underneath the breastbone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Narrowing most often occurs in the lower esophagus and is usually the result of stomach acid refluxing (backing up) into the lower esophagus, irritating it. If this happens over a long period of time, constriction or narrowing of the esophagus occurs too, and more foods get stuck when you swallow. The narrowing may be so gradual that you choose to stop eating difficult-to-swallow foods like steak without even realizing it. Or you may simply lose weight. At its worst, this condition can progress to the point of complete blockage, in which case relieving the obstruction may require emergency treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                A major reason to evaluate this problem early—long before complete blockage occurs—is to prevent the development of cancer of the esophagus, which can arise from this type of long-standing irritation. A gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in the stomach and colon, can insert a special tube with a small video camera into your mouth and down the esophagus. By obtaining and examining a small piece of the esophagus through biopsy, he or she can determine whether a long-standing irritation or cancer is present.

            The symptom of a severe sore throat may lead to a throat infection that can close off your airway and cause you to strangle. Though this is rare, you need to watch out for any signs of infection.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Three major kinds of infection can endanger the airway: a pus pocket around the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess); an infection in the floor of the mouth, which spreads throughout the jaw and around the teeth (Ludwig’s angina); and an infection of the epiglottis (the flap over your windpipe that keeps food from entering). You can prevent these infections by seeking treatment for your sore throat before it worsens.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since sore throats are so common, how do you know when you may be in danger? Make sure your condition improves over a forty-eight-hour period. Never let it go longer before seeking medical attention. You might even want to get help earlier if your sore throat sets in after a dental procedure; your condition is more dangerous in this scenario because it can spread faster.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is <i>always</i> an emergency if you experience hardness or swelling in the floor of your mouth and around the base of your tongue, if you have difficulty opening your mouth, or if you notice saliva drooling from your mouth. Also, more serious throat infections are often much worse if they occur on one side of your throat. When you open your mouth and look in the mirror, if the dangling skin hanging in the back of your throat (the uvula) shifts to one side rather than pointing downward, go to your doctor or the emergency room.
            </p>

            <p>
                Keep aware of your symptoms, because it is possible for your sore throat to improve after receiving antibiotics, only to later become worse. Without you knowing it, germs may be digging deeper into the tissues of your throat and setting up an abscess (pus pocket) that bulges into your airway, narrowing it. At this point the pain will usually increase and your fever will become higher, thus indicating that you need further medical treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Occasionally a sore throat that does not respond to treatment after a number of weeks is caused by a tumor located deep within the throat.  These tumors can only be seen when the doctor uses a special small mirror or camera to look into your mouth.

            If you have a severe sore throat with fever and a fiery red rash all over your body, seek medical evaluation right away. You may have scarlet fever. If this is the case, your tongue may also look like an intensely red strawberry, and your throat may turn red with white splotches.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Scarlet fever is caused by a rare type of the same germ that gives you strep throat. The germ releases a toxic substance into the bloodstream, which causes the red rash (your skin may also peel off as though you have been sunburned). The release of this toxic substance can lead to heart and kidney disease, so antibiotic therapy is needed as soon as possible to avoid life-threatening complications. Note: This disease was much more common before the use of antibiotics.

            If you have a sore throat, followed by fever and joint swelling about two weeks later, watch out. You can get rheumatic fever from strep throat that was inadequately treated.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Rheumatic fever is a complication of a strep throat that usually occurs two to three weeks after having strep throat. It can cause the joints in your body to become swollen and painful. Fever and swelling are reactions of the body to the infection caused by the streptococcus germ. Rheumatic fever can also cause the heart muscle to become inflamed, and can thereby permanently damage the heart valves.
            </p>

            <p>
                While rheumatic fever is most common in children who are between five and fifteen years old, it can also occur in adults. Adequate treatment of the initial sore throat is the secret to preventing rheumatic fever. If your doctor prescribes a course of antibiotics, make sure you take <i>all</i> of the medicine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other complications of a strep infection are acute glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidneys) and scarletina (see scarlet fever, Tip 40), which has the appearance of a red rash.
