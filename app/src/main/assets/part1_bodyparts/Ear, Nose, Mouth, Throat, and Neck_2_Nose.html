            Nosebleeds are usually easily controlled but can be fatal in rare cases.

            <p>
                The majority of nosebleeds originate from just inside the nostril on the wall that separates the nostrils, called the septum. External compression, such as pinching the sides of the nose, just below the bony area, for a full ten to fifteen minutes with the head bent forward and applying an ice pack to the bridge of the nose usually helps stop the bleeding. Do not stop the compression during that time period to see if the bleeding has stopped. If compression does not stop the nosebleed, it may be bleeding from deeper within the nose. Lightly packing the nose with gauze or cotton can usually control this deeper type of bleeding. Allow the material to protrude from the nostrils so you can easily pull it out afterward. Sometimes soaking the cotton with medicines like Afrin or Neo-Synephrine can help, but you need to check the patient package insert to make sure that there are no contraindications for you to use them. (For example, if you have high blood pressure, it is best not to use these medications unless this is the only option to stop a severe nosebleed.) These steps will control the majority of nosebleeds. To avoid a recurrence, try not to blow your nose for at least six hours after treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you still have a nosebleed after you have tried all of these methods, seek medical attention immediately. Some bleeding sites, deep in the catacombs of the nasal passage, are particularly difficult to access and control. When injured, the major blood vessels located there are more susceptible to severe bleeding. Typically the blood will stream to the back of your throat, requiring constant swallowing. This problem poses a challenge even to an ear, nose, and throat specialist.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nosebleeds are more severe in people with high blood pressure. Most result from a crack or ulcer on the nasal passage, often from dry air, chronic allergic congestion, or a growth called a polyp. If you have a disease or take a drug that impairs blood clotting, including aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and warfarin (Coumadin), or if you routinely drink too much alcohol, you are at particular risk of severe blood loss from a nosebleed.

            Infections of the upper lip or nose can be dangerous and may spread to the inside of the head.

                You’ve heard of the Bermuda Triangle and its dangers, but you may not have heard of the “dangerous triangle”.  The body has one, and it has perils as well. The apex or tip of the triangle is at the forehead between the eyebrows. The angles of the triangle are at the corners of the mouth.
            </p>

            <p>
                This triangle differs from other areas of the face and head in one very important way: Blood brought to this area by the arteries will return to the heart through the veins that travel inside the skull rather than the ones that reside outside the skull. Why is this important? Germs that have gained entrance to the circulation in this location have a direct route to the brain and other structures inside the skull. Infections in the brain can quickly spread to the vital centers responsible for normal life functions, and can therefore be fatal.
            </p>

                An infected bump, boil, or any infection on the upper lip or inside or outside of the nose holds a greater threat of serious complications than many infections elsewhere on the face or head. Signs of infection are tenderness, warmth, swelling, and redness. When they occur, see your doctor as soon as possible. Due to the seriousness of infection in this locale, you should not delay seeking treatment by using home remedies, except for the most mild surface sores. Picking or squeezing the infected area can spread the infection. <i>Do not</i> pop pimples in this area.
