            Antivenom shots may save your life if you are bitten by a poisonous snake. The area of the bite is often swollen and painful.

<p>
                If the snake’s poison gets into your bloodstream, death may be sudden unless you can get immediate treatment. Examination of the snake (dead or alive) can determine if it is poisonous, helping the doctor decide what treatment is necessary. Do not attempt to capture or kill the snake if it puts you in danger of another bite, but, if safe to do so, bring the snake or its remnants to the doctor’s office. At the very least, try to get an accurate description of the snake.
            </p>

                The following steps should be taken at the time you are bitten, if they will not cause excessive delay in getting you medical care:
                <ul>
<li>Stay calm.</li>
<li>Try to immobilize the area that has been bitten.</li>
<li>Wipe the wound with a clean cloth to remove poison left on the skin.</li>
<li>Do not apply a tourniquet, cut open the bite, or suction or tamper with the wound in any way.</li>
<li>Seek emergency medical care.</li>
</ul>
