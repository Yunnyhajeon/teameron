</div>

        <p>
            Choking often happens because something is obstructing the airway. The choking person may have a sudden onset of coughing and redness, or he or she may suddenly turn blue in color and be unable to cough or speak.
        </p>
        <p><b>Partial Airway Obstruction</b></p>
        <p>
            If the choking person is still able to cough and/or speak, stay with them and encourage them to continue coughing. Pay close attention and be prepared to act when needed.
        </p>
        <p><b>Full Airway Obstruction</b></p>
        <p>
            If the choking person is unable to cough or speak, you need to act rapidly before they become limp and pale.
        </p>
        <p><b>How to Help If the Person Is Above the Age of One and Conscious—Abdominal Thrusts, i.e., the Heimlich Maneuver</b></p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Position:</b> Kneel or stand behind the child or adult with your arms joined firmly against his or her upper abdomen in the center, between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage (see Figure 17). If the person is alert and conscious, explain gently what you are about to do.</li>
            <li><b>Action:</b> Give up to five rapid, firm, upward thrusts until the object dislodges and the individual begins to breathe. Try to avoid pulling on the ribs.</li>
            <li><b>If no success:</b> If the victim is still conscious, repeat the maneuver. If he or she becomes unconscious, begin CPR. (See the following guidelines for CPR.)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <p><b>IN THE CASE OF PREGNANCY OR OBESITY</b></p>
        In pregnant or obese persons, you may need to place your hands or arms at the location of the chest, that is, the center of the breastbone, instead of below the rib cage. If you are unable to get your arms around the person from behind, you can have them put their back against a wall, and you can provide the thrusts directly to the front of the chest. Give up to five rapid, firm chest thrusts—either from behind or from the front.
        </p>

        <p>
        <p><b>IF YOU ARE ALONE AND CHOKING</b></p>
        Find a hard, blunt edge (for example, the back of a chair or the edge of a countertop), and drop yourself onto it, so that the edge strikes you between the belly button and the bottom of the rib cage. Repeat the action until the object is dislodged.

        <p>
            Pick up a telephone (if available) and dial 911. A regular landline telephone is better than a cell phone; in most cases, emergency services will be able to track your location from the call, even if you are unable to speak. If you must use a cell phone, be sure to give them your exact location immediately if you are still able to speak.
        </p>

        <p><b>How to Help an Infant Under the Age of One:</b></p>
        <i>Note: If it is a child with croup, suspected epiglottitis, or asthma (see Tips 210 and 211), do not undertake these procedures unless he/she cannot utter a sound and is clearly choking.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>IN THE CASE OF A CONSCIOUS  INFANT</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Position:</b> Place the infant face down on your arm, with the child’s head and neck below his/her trunk (e.g., on your knee). Support his or her neck and head with one hand.</li>
            <li><b>Action:</b> Using the heel of your other hand, give him/her approximately five firm, quick blows between the shoulder blades, forcefully enough to expel the object. The object should come out.</li>
            <li><b>If no success:</b> Turn the infant face up on your lap or on a firm surface, and support his/her head and neck with one hand. Use two fingers of your other hand to thrust inward and upward five times in the center of the breastbone, one finger-width below the nipple line. Watch the mouth, and remove the offending object with your pinky finger as soon as it appears.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Continue the above maneuvers (five back blows, five chest thrusts) until one of two things happens: the object is expelled and the infant begins to cry, or the infant becomes unconscious or unresponsive.
        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>If still no success:</b> Call an ambulance (911 in most locations).</li>
            <li><b>Position:</b> Turn the infant faceup on a hard surface (tabletop, counter, or floor).</li>
            <li><b>Action:</b> Look in the mouth for any object on which the infant could be choking. If you see anything, use your pinky finger to remove the object. Do not blindly sweep fingers into the infant’s mouth.</li>
            <li>If you are unable to see anything, open the airway by tilting the head back very slightly (if at all), put your mouth over the baby’s nose and mouth, and give 2 gentle breaths (puffs of air, using only the amount of air you can hold in your cheeks).</li>
            <li>Watch to see if the chest rises and falls. </li>
            <li>If the chest does not rise and fall, the airway may still be blocked. Immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two attempted breaths. (See the following guidelines on CPR.) Check the mouth for the object each time you are about to provide a breath. Do not reach into the infant’s mouth unless you see an object to remove. </li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>If the chest does rise and fall, stop and reassess whether the infant has begun breathing. Keep the infant’s airway open with a slight tilt and look toward the chest for chest rise, feel for breath on your cheek, and listen for sounds of breathing. If the infant is not breathing on his or her own, immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two breaths. (See the following CPR guidelines.)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>*Special note:</b> Remember when alone with a child or infant it is always best to initiate two minutes of care before calling 911. If there are any bystanders, have them contact 911 while you begin care.
        </p>

        <p><b>Choking Prevention in Children</b></p>
        The best way to save a child from choking is to avoid it altogether. In general, children under three years old are the most at risk. Within this age range, children between nine months and two years are particularly prone to choking. At this stage, they are increasingly mobile and very likely to put items in their mouth, but are not yet responsive to your commands. Supervise your child well, and keep small items out of reach. Check under furniture and between cushions for small items (such as pen/marker caps, thumbtacks, etc.) that children could find and put in their mouths. Also supervise the actions of older children (such as siblings) who may give a younger child an object that poses a choking threat.

        </p>

        <p>When choosing playthings for small children, be sure to follow the age recommendations on the toy packages. Also, think carefully before giving your child certain foods, and supervise infants and young children at mealtime. Do not allow them to run, play, or lie down with food in their mouths.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Toys and Household Objects with Particular Risks</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Balloons:</b> Balloons are the most common cause of fatalities from choking. Always supervise children under the age of six when playing with balloons. Use Mylar, not latex, balloons, and make sure to dispose of broken pieces of balloons immediately. Note: Balloons pose a choking risk to children of any age.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Small items:</b> Avoid giving a child any item that can fit entirely into his or her mouth or with small (under two inches) parts. This includes coins, small balls, marbles, beads, medicine syringes, and toy food. If it can fit through the opening of a toilet paper roll, it is too small for a young child.</li>
            <li><b>Small batteries:</b> These are especially dangerous, as sometimes the acid can seriously damage the stomach lining.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <p><b>Foods with Particular Risks</b></p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Nuts, seeds, or popcorn:</b> These are the most commonly inhaled foods. Do not give these to an infant or young child.</li>
            <li><b>Firm fruits or vegetables:</b> Prepare carrots, grapes, apples, pears, and celery appropriately: Peel them, chop them finely, or cook them until soft.</li>
            <li><b>Sausages:</b> It’s safest not to give sausages to children under six years old.</li>
            <li><b>Hot dogs:</b> It’s safest not to give hot dogs to children under six years old.</li>
            <li><b>Chunks of meat, cheese, or peanut butter:</b> Shred or grate any firm cheeses. Spread soft cheese or peanut butter on a cracker or piece of bread. Grind, crumble, or shred meat into small bits before serving to an infant or young child.</li>
            <li><b>Raisins, prunes, or apricots:</b> Boil any dried fruits so they become soft and easily chewed. Prunes and apricots need to also be cut into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li><b>Hard, gooey, or sticky candy:</b> Do not give hard candy to children under the age of three.</li>
            <li><b>Chewing gum:</b> Avoid giving gum to young children.</li>
            <li><b>Marshmallows:</b> Do not let children play any games where they try to fit as many large marshmallows in their mouth as possible. When a marshmallow is pulled into the airway, it becomes moist and sticky, and then expands.</li>
        </ul>
