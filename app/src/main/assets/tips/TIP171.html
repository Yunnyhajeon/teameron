            On rare occasions certain medications can cause fatal reactions, starting with a rash with targetlike lesions. This distinctive symptom is usually accompanied by sores in the mouth, nose, eyes, anus, and/or genital region, and a low-grade fever. Though extremely dangerous, this condition is treatable and curable if caught early.

                This condition is called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and it can cause a severe allergic reaction that may damage a large area of the skin, causing it to blister and slough off. When this condition develops, seizures, coma, and death can follow, so early diagnosis and treatment are essential. If you develop a rash after starting a medication, get in touch with a doctor (preferably your own physician) immediately.
