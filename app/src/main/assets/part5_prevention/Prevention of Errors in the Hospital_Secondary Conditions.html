            Pneumonia and flu can be contracted from other patients while you are in the hospital. This is particularly dangerous (and there is a higher risk of a resulting fatality) if you are   elderly.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Reduce the risk of developing pneumonia and influenza. Particularly if you are elderly, make sure that you are up-to-date on all your vaccinations, and that you are not placed in a room with anyone who is infectious. Many doctors recommend that hospitalized patients take a few deep breaths and cough to clear their airway every hour or so. Some doctors even prescribe the use of a spirometer to facilitate deep breathing. It is felt that these measures decrease the risk of developing infections in the lungs. (See Tip 72 for more on pneumonia.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: It may be helpful to remind yourself to breathe deeply at set times, for example during commercial breaks if you are watching TV.

            If you have ever had a blood clot, you are at an increased risk of having another, no matter why you are in the hospital. Discuss this with your physician immediately upon being admitted to the hospital, since you may need anticoagulation (blood thinning) to prevent a recurrence. This treatment is called deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Note: There are a few rare situations in which active bleeding could prohibit this strategy.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A previous blood clot is not the only reason that you might need a blood thinner while you are in the hospital. An immobilizing illness and prolonged bed confinement both increase your risks of getting a blood clot, whether you have had one before or not. Therefore, if your condition is serious and you are bound to your hospital bed, it might be a good idea for you to start prophylactic anticoagulation (blood-thinning medication). Another reason you might want this preventative therapy is if you are massively obese. Since massively obese people have poor circulation, they are more likely to develop blood clots.
            </p>

            <p>
                The use of prophylactic anticoagulation is also extremely important after certain surgical procedures. Orthopedic procedures are at the top of this list. Almost any operation on a major bone, such as hip replacement or knee replacement, warrants anticoagulation. Discuss this with your doctor before and after your admission to the hospital, as well as before and after your operation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mortality from blood clots is quite high, so it is well worth your effort to take every possible step to prevent them. There are a number of simple measures for reducing the risk of developing blood clots, which include getting out of bed and walking around intermittently, if tolerated. There are also intermittent compression devices that your doctor may prescribe if appropriate. These are placed around the legs to squeeze and massage the calves, and thus improve circulation. (For more on blood clots, see Tips 64 and 81.)

            If you have coronary heart disease and need surgery, taking the medication referred to as a “betablocker” before, during, and after your operation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications from the  surgery.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                This tip applies to surgery performed anywhere on a person with coronary heart disease, not just operations on the heart or blood vessels.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a few contraindications concerning the use of these medications, especially for patients with certain heart or lung conditions, but the majority of patients who need them are able to take them. Mention beta-blockers to your surgeon just to make sure that the possibility of using them has not been overlooked. Multiple assistants may be involved in your care, and somebody on the team may have forgotten to prescribe this medication.

            In certain surgical cases, taking the right antibiotic within one hour before your skin is surgically cut will reduce your likelihood of getting an infection.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
                This very important discovery was made by investigators reviewing two million cases in the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. It is so important that it has become the standard of care in all American hospitals. Make sure that the proper antibiotic is given if you are having one of certain surgical procedures performed, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Blood vessel surgery</li>
                <li>Colon/large intestine surgery</li>
                <li>Hip joint replacement surgery</li>
                <li>Hysterectomy</li>
                <li>Knee joint replacement surgery</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The proper use of preoperative antibiotics involves two steps. Number one: selecting the appropriate antibiotic for the anticipated surgical procedure, taking into account the patient’s history of medication allergies. Number two: making absolutely sure that it is given within one hour of the actual surgical incision. Sometimes the antibiotic is given in the operating room. If it is given too early or after the skin is cut, its effectiveness is lost.
            </p>

            <p>
                This seems simple enough. You would expect it to happen 100 percent of the time or at least nearly 100 percent. Not so. The compliance to this required safety measure is often as low as 60 percent in some hospitals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Discuss the use of antibiotics with your surgeon before you go to the hospital, and consider insisting that the surgery not be performed without it. If it comes time to cut and the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic has not been given to you an hour earlier, it may be necessary to reschedule the surgery, unless delaying it could cause serious health problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                This preemptive step of using a prophylactic antibiotic can prevent devastating infections that could cause prolonged hospitalization, deformities, disfigurations, and even death. It is a giant step forward in patient safety.
