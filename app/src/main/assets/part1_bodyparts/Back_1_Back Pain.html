            Back pain that originates just above the belt line on one side of the lower back, often accompanied by blood-tinged urine, indicates kidney disease that may require immediate medical attention. The pain is sometimes associated with fever and urination problems and is worsened when you gently tap the affected area.

                This type of back pain is sometimes accompanied by fever and/or pain and difficulty urinating. Also, pain is more likely to occur on the sides of the back and in the abdomen than exclusively in the center of the lower back (see Figure 13).
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important that you seek medical evaluation and treatment for this type of back pain as soon as possible. It may be caused by a kidney stone, which often requires medical intervention for removal. Also, if there is a kidney infection, antibiotics are required. (See Tip 130 for more information on evaluation and treatment of urinary tract infections. Also, see Appendix C, for information on preventive kidney screenings.)

            The sudden onset of severe back pain could be a compression fracture, which occurs when there is general weakness in the bones caused by a loss of bone density. It is more common in senior citizens and requires increased bed rest.

                Sudden agonizing back pain can be the result of a softening of the bones and a vertebral fracture. Weak bones are more susceptible to fractures and collapse.
            </p>

            <p>
                Osteoporosis (a loss of bone mass and softening of the bones) develops gradually and usually without symptoms. It often begins in older women after menopause, since the ovaries produce less estrogen, causing the bones to lose more calcium. All postmenopausal women should be evaluated for osteoporosis. Keep in mind, however, that it can also begin earlier in life, especially in patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and/or those who are taking steroids. It is more common in people who are small in size, are not physically active, are Caucasian or Asian, and who smoke. The early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis is an important preventative measure. Vitamin D and calcium supplements can often be very helpful if taken in the proper doses. (See Appendix C, page 384, for more about bone density screening.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Bones that bear weight, such as the vertebrae of the spine, are the first to experience a change from the softening, which is why older people tend to lose height. If a vertebra collapses in what is called a compression fracture, it can produce agonizing pain. Confinement to bed, often resulting from fractures of the spine, hips, and legs, is the enemy of senior citizens, as it may lead to an early death from blood clots or lung infections. Lying still creates an environment where blood is more stagnant and more likely to clot, so doctors often recommend that elder patients with fractures use a brace so that they can get out of bed and move around, rather than being sedentary.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ideally, seniors should attempt to avoid fractures in the first place. New treatment options are available to increase the thickness (mass) of the bones and thus strengthen them. This preventive therapy may be appropriate for those with osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency. However, the side effects and costs of the treatment must be considered before starting it. If you have osteoporosis, you should discuss the pros and cons of this therapy with your physician.

            Severe back and, in certain cases, leg pain, especially when accompanied by a fever, may mean you have a serious infection rather than a backbone problem such as a disk herniation or spur. If the pain is caused by an infection, often the lower back will be tender to the touch. Senior citizens and/or debilitated people are more vulnerable to these massive infections.

                At first the symptoms may seem mild: some redness around a cut on your leg (which only appears to be a minor infection), pain during urination, and/or a chest cold that just seems to get worse. Afterward you develop a major symptom: an overwhelming and agonizingly severe pain in your lower back and legs. The pain is so severe that you don’t mention your earlier symptoms when you visit your doctor—they seem so minor in comparison. The doctor can easily assume your back pain is being caused by a run-of-the-mill muscle strain or lumbar disk disease and may make the wrong diagnosis. This error could have dire consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though it happens rarely, minor infections can spread rapidly through the bloodstream to locations throughout the body. Fever and severe back pain, frequently accompanied by leg pain, may be the signal that this has happened. Sometimes if a massive infection has overwhelmed the body’s defense mechanism, there will be no fever. It is crucial that the victim is immediately treated by a doctor, with life-saving intravenous antibiotics.
            </p>

            <p>
                An important message here is that you should always carefully report all of your symptoms to the doctor, even if they seem minor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Sometimes a minor infection will not spread throughout the body but will advance into a serious pocket of pus, called an abscess, which often needs to be drained by a surgeon. (For an example of this, see Tip 119.)
