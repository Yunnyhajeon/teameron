            Rocky Mountain spotted fever is identified by a high fever and a rash that appears as little red/ purple pinpoint blood spots or splotches. The rash usually begins on the wrists and ankles or the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet and then spreads over the body. It is transmitted by ticks, so you will reduce your risk if you use insect repellent and remove any ticks from your body after each day spent in the woods.

                Rocky Mountain spotted fever germs gain entrance to the body through the bite of a carrier tick, and then spread throughout the body. Within fourteen days, you will develop the rash and a fever, often accompanied by weakness, chills, a headache, and a generalized flat rash. This rash has an unusual appearance and pattern that does not often occur in other acute illnesses associated with a fever. Since this disease can be fatal, immediate medical attention is necessary, even if the tick is not found. In 10 percent of cases, there is only a high fever and possibly a bad headache with no rash until itâ€™s too late for you to be saved. If you develop an unexplained fever in the summertime, especially if you live in areas where cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are commonly reported, seek medical attention. In the United States, these include North Carolina and Oklahoma.

                Also, ticks need time to spread disease, so check your body for ticks immediately after you return from the woods. Dousing a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and holding it over the tick will relax the creature so that you can pluck it safely off of your skin with a pair of tweezers. Make certain you remove the entire tick by placing the tweezers at the base of the head (where the neck would be) and pulling gently.
