            Indigestion may be a sign of a heart attack. You should be especially concerned about:
            <br/>•	Indigestion with exercise or exertion
            <br/>•	Indigestion with a dizzy sensation
            <br/>•	Indigestion with a cold sweat
            <br/>•	Indigestion with numbness or pain radiating to the jaw or shoulder
            <br/>•	Indigestion with pressure in the chest
            <br/>•	Indigestion that does not respond to the usual medicines

                Most of the time indigestion is not a serious disorder. But sometimes it can be a symptom of a heart attack. Though it is more often serious when associated with other symptoms, as listed above, it can still be the red light warning signal of a heart attack when it appears alone.
            </p>
<p>
                Under the above circumstances an immediate visit to the emergency room may save your life.
