            If your child develops signs of puberty too early, he or she should be evaluated. Signs of puberty may include rapid growth, hair growth (pubic and armpit), acne, and adult body odor, as well as breast enlargement and the onset of menstruation in girls or increasing genitalia size, a deepening voice, and growth of facial hair in boys. These signs can be due to an infection, a hormone problem, a tumor, a brain abnormality, or a brain injury.
