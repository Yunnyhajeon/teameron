                for women, cholesterol levels should be checked every two years. Ideally, this should be done by getting a fasting blood test called a lipoprotein profile (which requires fasting for nine to twelve hours beforehand). This tests for your current levels of total cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), HDL (high-density lipoprotein), and triglycerides (other blood fats). A high level of LDL, which is the bad or “lousy” cholesterol, can lead to serious medical problems such as a heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. A low HDL, which is the good or “happy” cholesterol, could also contribute to these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
A family history of high cholesterol and/or a diet high in the bad cholesterol (for example, if you eat too many high-fat animal foods) puts you at a high risk for cholesterol problems. Under these circumstances, you should be screened for high cholesterol more often and eat more foods that help elevate your good cholesterol, such as unsalted nuts and certain kinds of fish (for example, salmon and trout).
</p>
<p>
If you are taking medications for high cholesterol and/or are on a special low-fat diet, and if you have other risk factors for heart disease, your doctor will recommend more frequent cholesterol testing (for example, every six to twelve months). The more risk factors you have, the more likely you will have or family history of heart attacks, coronary stents, or bypass surgery are risk factors for heart disease. Other important risk factors include diabetes, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, high blood pressure (140/90 mm Hg and above, or you are on blood pressure medications), increasing age (forty-five or older for men, fifty or older for women), and/or a combination of risk factors called the metabolic syndrome (most common in middle-aged men with abdominal obesity).
</p>
<p>
Any child who has a close relative with heart disease (for example, a mother, father, or sibling) might benefit from a cholesterol screening at the age of two, and many doctors recommend at least one blood cholesterol screening at age twenty.

<p><b>Type 2 Diabetes Screening</b></p>
Anyone at a high risk for developing type 2 diabetes should get screened every three years starting at an early age. Many doctors feel that everybody (even without risk factors) should be routinely tested, starting at least at the age of forty. The doctor orders a fasting glucose test or glucose tolerance test to see if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal. If these levels are high, your treatment plan may include diet, exercise, and/or medications. Detecting diabetes early is important, since it can damage your heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, or blood vessels if it is not treated. Any result over 100 merits
