                If you have ever had a blood clot, you are at an increased risk of having another, no matter why you are in the hospital. Discuss this with your physician immediately upon being admitted to the hospital, since you may need anticoagulation (blood thinning) to prevent a recurrence. This treatment is called deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Note: There are a few rare situations in which active bleeding could prohibit this strategy.
