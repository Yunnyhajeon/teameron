            Lower-right belly pain and tenderness may indicate appendicitis. Appendicitis is a serious disease that can be fatal if the appendix ruptures.

<p>
                Typically an early diagnosis of appendicitis allows it to be cured via surgery. But without proper treatment, the appendix can rupture, causing infection to spread throughout the belly cavity. This can be fatal.
            </p>
<p>
                Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a fingershaped structure projecting from the first part of the colon. Swelling and inflammation at the spot where the appendix is attached to the colon can block its blood supply, leading to gangrene in its tip and, ultimately, its rupture.
            </p>
<p>
                Appendicitis often causes a bellyache. This pain may be vague and dispersed throughout the belly, and then will often (but not always) localize to the lower-right area of the belly, which will become tender to the touch. This usually occurs over a forty-eight-hour period and will continue to get worse until the appendix ruptures, at which time the pain may lessen. A sudden reduction of your pain may mean that your condition is actually worse, not better.
            </p>
<p>
                The pain of appendicitis is occasionally located in other areas, including the right side of the lower back (if the appendix projects up the back side of the colon) or the upper-right belly (if the first part of the colon is displaced to this area, as during pregnancy).
            </p>
<p>
                Other tip-offs that may accompany appendicitis include a low-grade fever (not usually over 101.5 degrees), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or constipation. If you suspect appendicitis, you should go to an emergency room for immediate  medical evaluation.
