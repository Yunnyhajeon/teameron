                If for any reason you don’t feel safe, report this to the nursing supervisor. If you still do not feel safe, request a visit from the case management team, the patient advocate, and/or the compliance officer of the hospital. Do not remain silent. Voice your fears and concerns so that they can be properly addressed.

            Make sure help is available: Rapid physician response to a sudden change in a patient’s condition can save lives.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            There are teams of doctors and nurses specifically assigned to respond to any change in a patient’s condition long before he/ she experiences cardiac arrest and a “code” is called. However, a significant change in a patient’s condition may be missed by the nursing staff. Inquire about the availability of rapid response teams and how they can be accessed if the family identifies a problem. If a rapid response program does not exist at your hospital, suggest that they implement one.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            If you observe anything that is occurring that isn’t right or appears questionable, “stop the line.”
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
            Every hospital should have a “stop the line” policy that clearly states that when anyone observes an event involving the care of a patient that is, or appears to be, in error, they should immediately notify the floor nurse, who should “stop the line”.  This means that every activity involving that patient should stop until whatever is in question is resolved. Ask and make sure that this is a hospital policy. You and/or your advocates should use it when it’s necessary. For example, if a nurse brings in a medicine for you that appears to be different from what you have been taking, you should question the change. If the nurse then discovers a mistake has been made, he or she should “stop the line” to find out why. Maybe there is someone with the same name or a similar name on the hospital floor. In this case, the error could happen again if the necessary precautions are not taken. Make certain that if there is an actual error, its cause has been resolved. If possible, this should be done before care measures are resumed. In such a case, special identifiers should be put in place. For example, a note might be placed on the front of the chart and/or on the door of the room.
            </p>
            Note: Sometimes the same generic medicine is manufactured as pills that look different.
