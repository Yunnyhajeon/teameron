            Chronic or persistent hoarseness, often with difficulty breathing, may be caused by papilloma (viral induced growths) on the vocal chords. Chronic hoarseness and/or pain when swallowing may be the first signs of gastric reflux. A child with any of these symptoms should be evaluated. If the growths (warts) become large, they can obstruct breathing. Also they can progress farther down the airway and become impossible to treat.
