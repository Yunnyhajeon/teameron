            You have survived a heart attack and you have every reason to be happy. Your cardiac rehab is progressing
            well, but you don’t feel like you want to do anything. Being around other people is a burden so you avoid
            them. What’s going on? Call your doctor and find out. You may be depressed. Depression is more common in
            heart attack victims and reportedly poses an additional health threat beyond its psychological ill-effects.
            Depression may contribute to the development of many potentially life-threatening medical conditions such as
            heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.

                It has been clearly established from multiple scientific studies that patients’ outcomes following a
                heart attack can be adversely affected by depression (see Tip 12 for the symptoms of depression). There
                are changes in the body’s chemistry when depression occurs that can affect the automatic control
                mechanisms of the body’s vital organs. No one has determined how these changes reduce survival rates or
                increase the likelihood of heart attack complications, but there is overwhelming evidence that they do.
                Depressed heart attack patients are more likely to have a subsequent, fatal heart attack.

                It is important for you to remember that there is no way to diagnose depression unless you discuss the
                condition with your doctor. Remember also that there are effective treatments for depression that may
                improve your odds of recovery.

                Patients often think they feel down because they have just had a heart attack. They do not realize that
                the depression itself could possibly increase their risk of dying from another heart attack. So when
                you’re feeling down after having a heart attack, talk it over with your doctor. It might save your life.
