                        Miscommunication among physicians, nurses, and hospital personnel is a major cause of medical errors. Ask your doctor what his/her schedule is and which doctor covers for him/her on off hours. Make sure that all of the doctors who are caring for you know why you are in the hospital, as well as what your diagnostic and treatment plans are, particularly during the next twenty-four hours.

                        When you are taken from your hospital room, make sure to ask where youâ€™re being taken and why. When you arrive at another location, ask what is to be done. Make sure all the answers from the different practitioners are consistent. Also, upon any visit to the ER, make sure that your own medical specialist(s) is contacted and advised or consulted with if you have a past medical history relating to your current condition.
