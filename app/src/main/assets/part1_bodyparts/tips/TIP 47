            A short episode of numbness on one side of your face, with slurred speech, weakness in an arm and/or leg, double vision, and/or “vertigo” (an unbalanced feeling), which lasts temporarily (usually minutes to hours), is a TIA (transient ischemic attack) if a certain area of the brain is not getting enough blood. Another symptom you may experience during a TIA is momentary blindness.
