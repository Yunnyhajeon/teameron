            The passage of pale, putty-colored stools can be due to the blockage of substances normally secreted by the liver into the intestine.

<p>
                Stools are normally dark, light brown, or green in color. If your stools become pale clay or putty-colored, it means that there is a lack of bile (the substance that provides the normal pigment in stools) passing through the bile duct from the liver to the intestines. This indicates a blockage of the bile duct that can mean that you have liver disease, or that a gallstone or tumor is blocking the bile duct.
            </p>

                You should report this finding to your doctor as soon as possible, so that appropriate evaluation and treatment can be instituted. There is a potential for developing serious complications, including permanent liver damage.
