            Any bleeding, with or without belly cramps or uterine contractions, demands immediate medical evaluation if it is on or after the fifth month of pregnancy. It may be a warning sign of a life-threatening hemorrhage.

            The life-threatening causes of bleeding during the later stages of pregnancy are related to the location of the placenta or “afterbirth.” Usually a fertilized egg situates itself inside the upper wall of the uterus. As the embryo grows, it is connected by the umbilical cord to the placenta (which is attached to the uterine wall). The placenta is like a pancake, filled with many small blood vessels growing on the inside wall of the uterus.

                uterus, over the opening of the birth canal (the cervix), it is more likely to cause painless bleeding and may hinder the fetus’ growth, as blood supply to the fetus is compromised (see Figure 15-A). With a complete placenta previa (when the placenta completely covers the opening of the cervix), a C-section delivery is needed. This is usually performed prior to the thirty-seventh week of pregnancy.
            </p>

            In a condition called abruptio placentae, a normally placed placenta partially separates from the uterine wall and bleeds (see Figure 15-B). This condition is usually accompanied by severe abdominal pain and/or strong uterine contractions.

            In either case the baby can lose its blood supply, which deprives the baby of oxygen and nutrition, endangering its life. The mother’s life is also threatened because there is the potential of massive internal bleeding. Urgent medical evaluation and treatment are necessary.
