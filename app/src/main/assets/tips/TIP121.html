            A bout of severe or prolonged diarrhea that results in severe dehydration can be fatal.

                Severe or prolonged diarrhea can cause such severe dehydration (fluid loss) and loss of essential minerals that intravenous fluids and the replacement of minerals are needed on an emergency basis. Vomiting at the same time as the bout of diarrhea puts you at an even greater risk of dehydration. Also, emergency treatment may be needed even earlier in infants, the elderly, or people with chronic heart or kidney problems.

                Sudden and severe infectious diarrhea can be caused by many different bacteria (<i>Campylobacter</i>, <i>Salmonella</i>, and <i>Shigella</i>) or by other germs called protozoans (<i>Entamoeba</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and <i>Cryptosporidia</i>). They can make you sick with profuse, possibly bloody, life-threatening diarrhea.

                One of the most severe types of life-threatening diarrhea is called pseudomembranous colitis, which is caused by a toxin from the <i>Clostridium difficile</i> bacterium. This type of diarrhea is often thick with blood and mucus and may look as though you are shedding the lining of your colon. It can result in dehydration accompanied by extreme toxicity, and may lead to death. This condition can also be caused by an antibiotic you’ve taken for an infection someplace else in your body—it may kill the normal bacteria that live in your colon, thus promoting the growth of the bacterium that causes pseudomembranous colitis.

                Another bacterium that causes diarrhea is <i>E. coli</i>. Epidemics caused by one of the strains of <i>E. coli</i> result from eating undercooked beef or ingesting water that has been contaminated. Also, though it is rare in the Western world, one of the most dangerous and infectious types of diarrhea is cholera. Before traveling abroad, particularly to developing countries, check with your local health department to find out about the appropriate preventive measures. Of course, if you have diarrhea and have traveled out of the country, it is very important to let your doctor know your travel history. In addition to germs, many illnesses can cause severe diarrhea.

                In all cases of diarrhea you can become dehydrated (feeling dizzy, weak, etc.) and lose essential minerals, such as potassium. Therefore it is always important to replenish fluids and minerals as well as to diagnose the underlying cause of the diarrhea. Diarrhea that persists, contains blood, causes weight loss, is associated with fever, and/or wakes you up at night needs to be assessed by a physician immediately. If the dehydration progresses to the point that you feel dizzy when you sit up or stand up, or urine output stops altogether, call 911 or have someone take you to an emergency room immediately for evaluation and treatment.
