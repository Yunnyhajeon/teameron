            Prolonged exposure to cold can cause fatal body hypothermia.

                The body’s protective mechanisms maintain its temperature at around 98.6 degrees, which is necessary for carrying out normal body functions. Internal control mechanisms help maintain body temperature by routing blood away from the surface of the body (the area just beneath the skin) and the extremities (the arms and legs), and by shivering to generate heat. If the body still cannot contain warmth, the body temperature drops and symptoms begin to appear. They are:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Confusion and forgetfulness</li>
<li>Sluggishness and fatigue</li>
<li>Lack of coordination</li>
<li>Slurred speech</li>
<li>Shivering (when shivering stops, the condition is getting worse)</li>
<li>Heart palpitations (heartbeat is irregular, slow, or fast)</li>
</ul>
<p>
                If the body’s temperature continues to drop, it can lead to coma and death. Older adults are at the highest risk of becoming ill from their body temperature dropping.
            </p>

                If you encounter someone who is hypothermic:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Get the person to a warm room. Do not immerse them in a tub of hot water or place them in front of a heater or fireplace. The sudden exposure to excessive heat may worsen their condition.</li>
<li>Remove any wet clothing.</li>
<li>Cover the person with blankets.</li>
<li>Warm the person with close body contact, but do not rub their skin.</li>
<li>Offer the person warm fluids if they can drink. Do not give them an alcoholic beverage.)</li>
<li>Seek emergency medical assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
                Note: A hypothermic person can sometimes be revived even after prolonged cardiac arrest; it is thought that the low body temperature can prevent cell damage for an extended period of time.
