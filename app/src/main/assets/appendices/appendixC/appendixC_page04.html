                            <li>A clinical breast exam performed by the doctor should be part of a woman’s routine health exam. This should happen about every three years for women in their twenties and thirties and every year for women forty years of age or older.</li>
                        </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                
Many doctors recommend that all women should have a mammogram every year, beginning at the age of forty, especially those with a family history of breast cancer. Some health groups recommend getting a baseline mammogram at age thirty-five. Obviously, screenings for breast cancer may not be appropriate if a woman has a short life expectancy because of other medical problems or because she is elderly and frail. In general, survivors of breast cancer should continue to have a mammogram every year, regardless of age.
</p>
<p>
Women at increased risk should start screenings earlier and discuss with their doctor the pros and cons of having additional tests such as an MRI or ultrasound. Women with a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer should be checked for BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are genetic mutations linked to these diseases.
            </p>

            <p>Risk factors for breast cancer include:
                <ul>
                            <li>a previous history of breast cancer</li>
                            <li>a family history of breast cancer (if your mother, sisters, or daughters have had breast cancer, you are at a two to three times greater risk)</li>
                            <li>increasing age (85 percent of breast cancers occur after the age of 40 and half of all breast cancers occur in women over 65). Note: Younger women can also get breast cancer.</li>
                            <li>exposure to radiation</li>
                            <li>not having children</li>
                            <li>pregnancy at a late age (usually after 30)</li>
                            <li>early menstruation (before the age of 12)</li>
                            <li>going through menopause at a later age than normal (usually after 55)</li>
                            <li>long-term use of hormone replacement therapy with progesterone as a component</li>
                            <li>genetic predisposition (certain mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes)</li>
                            <li>the use of oral contraceptives</li>
                            <li>the regular consumption of alcohol</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>However, it’s important to remember that the NUMBER 1 RISK FACTOR FOR BREAST CANCER IS BEING A WOMAN. All women need to be conscientious about taking measures for early detection.</p>
