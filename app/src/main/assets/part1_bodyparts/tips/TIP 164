            If you have had a draining sore for months, and it will not heal—particularly if it is on your neck (usually around the angle of the jaw), your forearm, or your foot—you may have a serious body-invading fungus infection. There are many other treatable causes of nonhealing sores that also require immediate medical evaluation and treatment, such as scrofula, which is a cousin of tuberculosis.
