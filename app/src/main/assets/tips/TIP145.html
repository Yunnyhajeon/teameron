            If you have had a severe allergic reaction, the next time it could be worse—even life-threatening. Swelling of the lips and throat and difficulty breathing after a bee sting or exposure to another allergen  are  red  light  warning  signals.  Skip directly to Tip 169 if you are currently experiencing these symptoms.

                Serious allergic reactions can get worse with every episode. Vital areas of the body can become more sensitized, resulting in increasingly severe reactions with each exposure. Such sensitization can lead to massive swelling, with closure of the windpipe, shock, and death.

                If there is any possibility that you might be at risk of a severe allergic reaction to any biting or stinging insect, food, cosmetic, plant, dye, and so on, carry an emergency treatment kit with you at all times (see Tip 169). An immediate shot of adrenaline after a life-threatening reaction—with sudden shortness of breath, wheezing, and weakness—could save your life. Some treatments can reduce the severity of these allergic reactions. Consult your doctor or an allergist.
