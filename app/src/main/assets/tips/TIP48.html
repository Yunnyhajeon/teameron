            Shaking hands or hand tremors may be the first signs of a serious illness, including an overactive thyroid (which is simple to treat) or Parkinson’s disease (which is harder to  treat).

                The rhythmic shaking of a hand is often called a hand tremor. Besides hand tremors, you can also have tremors of your head and all of your limbs simultaneously, or tremors that are localized to only your head or one arm or leg. Your tremors may be fine and barely noticeable, or they may be coarse enough to shake the coffee out of a cup. Attempts at coordinated movements such as touching the tip of your nose with your index finger may worsen the tremors (the closer your finger gets to your nose, the worse the tremors get), and they will also be more apparent when you try to sign your name. These latter types of tremors are called intention or kinetic tremors and are most common with cerebellar (back brain) disorders that progress slowly and are not life-threatening. The most common hand tremors are called essential tremors. They are common with aging, have a gradual onset, sometimes run in families, and are not serious. However, there are many serious causes of hand tremors.

                Trembling hands may be an early sign of an overactive thyroid. It is important to diagnose this disease as early as possible, as it can injure the heart. The tremor caused by an overactive thyroid is usually very fine and hard to see, but it can be made evident by a simple test: Extend one of your arms with the palm of your hand up, and place a sheet of paper on the hand. If your hand is shaking, it will immediately become evident. Other symptoms of an overactive thyroid include intolerance to heat, sweating, weakness, anxiety, and weight loss. Another serious cause of tremors is Parkinson’s disease, which is also characterized by slowness of action, and increased tone or muscle rigidity. This latter symptom is much more disabling because it impedes movement. The tremor caused by Parkinson’s is initially found on one side of the body and then spreads to the other side. This kind of tremor is more pronounced when you are at rest. It is an asymmetric rest tremor. Sometimes it appears as though the individual is rolling a pill between his or her fingers. This tremor is accompanied by an expressionless face, stooping shoulders, and a shuffling walk. Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder in which a natural chemical known as dopamine is not produced in adequate supply by the brain. The average age of onset is about sixty years old. Parkinson’s-like disorders are sometimes caused by multiple small strokes or as a side effect of certain medications.

                A common cause of tremors in the young is substance abuse. Take note, though, that you do not have to be an alcoholic or crack addict to develop this type of tremor. The affected person could be a busy and stressed young executive, who works long hours without getting enough sleep, drinks too much coffee, drinks three or four scotch and sodas every night to “wind down,” and/or heavily smokes. This person may begin to notice that his or her hands shake in the mornings. This symptom could be caused by any of these factors alone—caffeine, alcohol, or lack of sleep—and the combination only makes it worse. The shaking may signal the beginning of substance dependency, and it should encourage the person to develop healthier habits. However, the first sign of tremors may sometimes show up shortly after a person stops drinking. These are called withdrawal tremors, and they are not a major cause for concern. They will likely eventually go away, and, had you continued your unhealthy lifestyle, you would undoubtedly have developed far more (and longer lasting) symptoms and health concerns.

                Certain prescription drugs can also cause tremors. In fact, strong tranquilizers cause them so often that additional medicines may be prescribed to prevent the tremors. Commonly used medication for certain stomach disorders (Reglan/ metoclopramide) can also cause tremors, or even a full-blown Parkinson’s-like disorder. It clears very slowly when the medication is stopped.

                It is important to seek medical evaluation early to determine the cause of your tremor, since treatment may prevent serious additional complications from the underlying problem.
