                Anorexia is common in preadolescent and adolescent girls and is sometimes even seen in boys. The affected individual has an overpowering fear of being fat, accompanied by behavior intended to result in weight loss, such as not eating, excessive exercise, etc. Bulimia tends to occur in older adolescents or adults and is associated with binge eating and purging (self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives). Bulimia can be more difficult to recognize in an individual, since body weight and shape may appear normal. However, frequent vomiting can cause wear of the enamel on the back teeth, which may be picked up during a routine dental checkup.

                An affected teenager may:
                <ul>
<li>Be preoccupied with their weight and body size</li>
<li>Avoid eating with the family and eat very little</li>
<li>Use laxatives and diuretics, and induce vomiting</li>
<li>Exercise excessively</li>
<li>Wear shapeless clothes</li>
<li>Have irregular menstrual periods or a persistent absence of periods</li>
<li>Develop fine, downy hairs on the face and trunk</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                There are many medical complications associated with anorexia and bulimia, which may include kidney and heart complications, damage to the esophagus and/or stomach, and aspiration pneumonia. Self-induced vomiting and purging with laxatives can also cause dangerous imbalances of electrolytes (minerals) in the blood. There is a 10 percent mortality rate among those who have anorexia.

                The earlier a diagnosis is made and professional help is obtained, the better chance that your daughter or son will have a normal adult life. Lead her/him by your positive example and good eating habits!
