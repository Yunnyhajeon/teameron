            Babies and young children can easily swallow a harmful medicine or a dangerous household item like bleach, batteries, etc. If your child does not talk yet, look for signs that they have been poisoned with a toxic substance. If you are in doubt, call your regional poison control center or the American Association of Poison Control Centers (1-800-222-1222) for advice.
