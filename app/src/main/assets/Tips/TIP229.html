            If your baby is jaundiced (has a yellow hue to the skin and/or eyes) during the first week of life, you need to talk to his/her doctor as soon as possible in order to determine if there is a risk of life-threatening complications from high levels of the substance bilirubin.

                Jaundice in the first week of life is often benign (not dangerous), but there are certain cases where it may be very serious.

            </p>
<p>
                If the bilirubin (the substance that causes the jaundice) reaches high levels, it can cross into the brain, causing brain damage or even death. Mild jaundice is very common, affecting 80 percent of premature babies and 60 percent of regular-term babies, and is not serious. But certain causes of jaundice can result in a dangerously high level of bilirubin.

            </p>
<p>
                A common cause of severe jaundice is an incompatibility between the mother’s blood type and the baby’s blood type. An inherited red blood cell disorder, including G6PD deficiency and sickle cell disease, can also cause severe jaundice. In these cases red blood cells are destroyed, and bilirubin is released into the bloodstream, causing the yellow coloring. Both of these conditions occur much more commonly in Asians and African Americans than in Caucasians. Since a yellow hue is harder to detect in these babies due to their skin coloring, their jaundice can be more easily detected by examining the color of their gums and the whites of the eyes. During the first weeks of life, babies have their eyes closed most of the time, so parents have to make a conscious effort to look carefully every day for the first week. Gently open your baby’s eyes and mouth to check for signs of yellowing. You may want to try darkening the room and using a flashlight. Babies open their eyes in the dark.


            </p>
<p>
                Be aware that jaundice during the first weeks of life may also be caused by an extremely serious bacterial infection in the blood or a urinary tract infection.

            </p>
<p>
                If there is no underlying illness, mild jaundice requires no treatment. Moderate jaundice can be treated easily by putting the baby under a special blue light, thus preventing the jaundice from becoming more serious. Severe jaundice may require an exchange blood transfusion, which is a major procedure.

                If your baby has these red light warning signals, see your doctor as soon as possible.
