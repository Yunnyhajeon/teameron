            An early sign of a potentially serious infection of the female organs is a foul-smelling, thick, greenish discharge from the vagina, often accompanied by lower belly discomfort.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A discharge like this and/or severe lower belly pain that is tender to the touch, is often the first sign of a serious infection in the female organs. This infection can spread into your womb (uterus) and fallopian tubes, causing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and it can then also spread into your belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Irritation of the vagina may be the only other symptom of PID. Alternatively, you may also have a fever of 101 degrees or higher, with weakness, nausea, vomiting, and generalized aching. As this condition progresses, pelvic pus pockets can form, and the infection can spread throughout the body. Scarring may occur in the area around the womb, which can impair fertility or even cause sterility. The scarring increases the risk of having a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes, which can burst, causing a life-threatening internal hemorrhage. (See Tip 192.) 
            </p>

            <p>
                Early medical evaluation and treatment of PID manifesting itself with a vaginal discharge (especially with lower belly discomfort) can prevent the dangerous spread of the infection.

            Yeast infections cause a red sore on the skin with a buttermilk or cottage cheese–type discharge from the vagina. These infections can also appear as white patches in the mouth. Repeated yeast infections in the vagina, on the skin, or in the corners of the mouth may be a warning sign of diabetes or AIDS, so if you have repeated yeast infections, see your doctor as soon as possible.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Yeast infections in the vagina frequently occur after a woman takes an antibiotic, because the antibiotic kills the normal bacteria in the vagina, allowing the ever-present yeast to overgrow. Often a white, clumpy discharge (like cottage cheese) will occur. These infections usually clear up promptly after treatment with an antifungal medication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Other common sites for yeast infections are on the skin near the groin, under the breasts, in the corners of the mouth, and even inside of the mouth. They are often accompanied by a burning sensation and a white discharge or plaque. These infections are usually also responsive to antifungal medication.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have repeated yeast infections, you should be tested for diabetes. High sugar levels in the blood, paired with a defense system that is defective in protecting against infection, will increase the incidence of yeast infections. Early diagnosis of diabetes with proper therapy can reduce your risk of serious complications, including kidney, blood vessel, and heart damage.
            </p>

            <p>
                HIV infection can also create an environment for repeated yeast infections, because it weakens the body’s immune system. Testing for HIV is appropriate for early treatment and preventive measures to limit the spread of the disease to others.

            A wart in the genital area in women may be a warning sign of developing cervical cancer (cancer of the mouth of the womb).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                A small, moist, fingerlike projection in the genital area may be caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The presence of HPV increases the risk that a woman will develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include having a high number of sexual partners, intercourse at a young age, taking oral contraceptives, not using condoms, smoking, and increasing age.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to see a physician on a regular basis for a thorough pelvic examination so that any malignant changes can be detected early. The Pap smear is the test used to check for abnormalities of the cervix. (See Appendix C, for details on routine Pap smear screening and HPV vaccinations.)

            Any woman, particularly a postmenopausal older woman, who experiences redness, itching, white patches, and/or an ulcer that does not heal in or near the genitals, should seek medical evaluation. Cancer is one possible cause of these symptoms. Cancer in this region may not appear as a growth, but as an irritated or ulcerated area.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Thinning of the skin in the genital area occurs as a result of a decrease in the levels of the hormone estrogen and as part of the aging process. Cancer of the lips of the vulva (the outside of the vagina) usually occurs long after menopause. It is a type of skin cancer, but it may appear only as an irritated area, with or without ulceration. These red light warning signals need to be evaluated by your doctor as soon as possible. They may go unnoticed unless you see your doctor on a regular basis for checkups.
