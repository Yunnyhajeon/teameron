            When your child has an asthma attack, you need to recognize the symptoms and know how to react immediately. The key to treating asthma is to prevent an attack from becoming severe (symptoms of a severe attack include struggling to breath, difficulty speaking, possibly turning blue, etc.). You can do this by responding appropriately to the first symptoms, which will be more innocuous and will include coughing, wheezing, etc. You also need to learn what triggers severe attacks of asthma for your child and try to specifically avoid these triggers. For many children with severe or persistent asthma symptoms, being placed on daily inhaled steroids can significantly improve quality of life with minimal to no side effects.
