            A serious, life-threatening allergic reaction, especially starting with a swollen, tingling, or numb tongue, lips, and/or throat and breathing problems may progress rapidly, becoming fatal within minutes. Hives and/or itching may also occur in the upper body. The allergic reaction can be reversed if medical treatment is started immediately.

                Allergic reactions are common. They can follow exposure to just about anything, but they usually occur from foods, certain plants, bee stings, or medicines. They are not dose-related— you can have a serious reaction following even a tiny exposure. And you can also develop allergic reactions to things you were not allergic to in the past.
            </p>
<p>
                Most allergic reactions result only in an itchy rash and swelling. Occasionally the swelling will become severe when it occurs in locations where there is loose skin, like the area around your eyes or groin. This massive swelling looks bad but is generally not dangerous; it responds well to medical treatment.
            </p>

                Sometimes, however, allergic reactions occur very rapidly and become life-threatening. The main cause of death in these cases is an inability to breathe, because severe swelling has blocked the airways. In addition, there is a collapse in blood pressure from the sudden dilation (expansion) of blood vessels throughout the body. If you exhibit the following symptoms within thirty minutes of exposure to an allergen, then you are in danger of a full-blown allergic reaction and need to get to an emergency room immediately, or need to receive an epinephrine shot on the spot:
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Swelling of the tongue and mouth</li>
<li>Hoarseness, a “lump in the throat” feeling, difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>Breathing problems, a cough, chest tightness, wheezing, and croup</li>
<li>Dizziness, with a cold sweat and/or profuse sweating</li>
<li>A pale or blue appearance</li>
<li>Abdominal cramps and/or vomiting</li>
<li>A loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<p>
                Be prepared! If you have had a severe allergic reaction in the past, it may be worse next time. Know the early symptoms of a severe allergy attack so that you can tell if you need immediate life-saving medical treatment. Also, ask your doctor for a home epinephrine kit—it contains a single shot of the drug epinephrine, which you can inject into your muscle. This medicine opens your airways and tightens your blood vessels, thus saving your life. However, the effects of the shot wear off within a few hours, and you will need to be admitted to an emergency room for observation and/or further treatment.

                To prevent allergic reactions, you need to first become familiar with your allergies. Make a record of all allergic reactions you have experienced and what caused them. The following are some of the most common substances to which people are allergic (called allergens):
            </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Foods:</b> shellfish, soybeans, nuts, milk, eggs, MSG, sulfites</li>
<li><b>Insect bites:</b> bees, wasps, ants</li>
<li><b>Drugs:</b> penicillin (most common), aspirin, sulfa-based drugs, ibuprofen or other non-aspirin pain medicine</li>
<li><b>Radiographic contrast material:</b> the fluid injected into you during a study such as a CT scan (a special computerized X-ray), an IVP (a special X-ray of your kidneys), angiography (special X-ray study of your arteries), etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
                An allergist is a medical specialist who can help you identify your specific allergies and teach you how you can avoid exposure to them. (In some cases he or she may recommend that you begin getting weekly allergy shots that will help immunize you to your allergies.) Inform any doctors and medical staff involved in your care of all of your allergies, especially if you are allergic to any medications or to the contrast material injected into you during X-ray procedures. Consider purchasing an engraved bracelet listing your allergens; your pharmacist should know where you can obtain one. This may be useful in emergency situations.

                There is a rare but potentially fatal ailment called angioedema that presents itself similarly to an allergic reaction. The red light warning signal of this condition is the isolated and painless swelling of a random body part—the tongue, the mouth, a hand or a foot, et cetera—without itching. People who have angioedema can spontaneously develop swelling in the windpipe, cutting off their air supply. These swellings are rare and often occur for no known reason, though they have been occasionally associated with high blood pressure and heart medications known as ACE inhibitors (check with your pharmacist or doctor to determine if any of the medications you are taking fall into this category). Urgent evaluation and treatment of this type of swelling is necessary. (See Tips 170 and 171 about allergies to medications. See Tip 231 for more information on allergies in children.)
