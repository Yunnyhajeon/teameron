            Pain under the breastbone after a vomiting episode, especially if bright red blood is vomited, may indicate
            a tear in the lining of the esophagus. Usually, the person has retched or vomited multiple times before
            blood appears in the vomit.

                The esophagus is the muscular tube that takes food from the throat, through the chest, to the stomach.
                Food does not just fall through the tube, but is squeezed through it by a wave of muscles in the wall of
                the esophagus. When vomiting occurs, the reverse happens: The stomach contracts, moving material into
                the esophagus, where the esophagus grabs it and—with a reversed wave of muscle contraction—hurls it out
                of the mouth. During episodes of severe vomiting, the squeezing of the muscle wall of the esophagus can
                be powerful enough to tear the lining of the lower esophagus near the opening to the stomach. A
                life-threatening hemorrhage or infection may follow.

                The wall of the esophagus can also weaken. Continued vomiting may lead to rupture, which is often fatal.
                Early signs of this condition indicate the need for emergency medical treatment.
