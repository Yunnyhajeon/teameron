            Anytime dark or bright red blood appears in the bowel movement, early medical evaluation and treatment may save your life.

                There are many reasons that you may pass blood from the rectum, but bright red blood that appears on your toilet tissue could be a sign of colon cancer. Detecting this cancer early could save your life. Colon cancer is one of the more common cancers. The thought that “It’s only hemorrhoids” has put a lot of colon cancer victims in early graves. Remember, even if you have hemorrhoids, the rectal bleeding could also be from cancer; rectal bleeding should be considered a sign of cancer until proven otherwise.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blood passing through the rectum can originate from anywhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth all the way to the anus. Possible sources of this blood are irritation and ulcers in the mouth, stomach, or intestines, as well as cancer in any of these areas. Even swallowing blood from a nose-bleed can cause it to appear in your bowel movements. Usually the darker the blood, the higher up the bleeding site is in the GI tract. The stools can become black and tarry if the bleeding site is high enough. Sometimes the stools will look normal if there is a small amount of bleeding or if the blood has been absorbed into the rest of the body from the GI tract.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a number of procedures your doctor can perform to detect whether you are bleeding, and if so, where. A sigmoidoscope (a tube with a miniature video camera attached) can be passed into the anus to examine sections of the large intestine, and a colonoscope can be used to reach ALL of the large intestine (colon). Though these procedures sound intimidating, they are not nearly as uncomfortable as they might seem. An FOB (fecal occult blood) test—conducted by placing fecal material on a special card—detects blood in the stool that is not visible to the naked eye. A positive fecal occult blood test may indicate cancer or other less serious conditions such as hemorrhoids.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also, when you bleed from the GI tract, you can develop anemia (a low blood count). This is a tip-off that you may have cancer of the colon, although there are many other reasons why you may have a low blood count.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a close relative who has had colon cancer, a family history of colon polyps, a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, or a personal history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, you are at a greater risk for developing colon cancer. If this is the case, you should establish a program of routine colonoscopy, even if you are young and do not have any symptoms. Whether you have a family history or not, routine screening exams every five years and checking for microscopic amounts of blood in the stool every year may be life-saving. Colon cancer screening should begin no later than age fifty. Many doctors recommend that if you have a family history, you should get screened ten years earlier than the age your family member was diagnosed. For example, if your mother was diagnosed at age forty, you should start getting screened at age thirty. (Also see Appendix C, about early detection of cancer in the GI tract.) Early detection without any warning signs can lead to a cure; remember, this disease is not rare!

                If you pass red or dark blood in your bowel movement, seek medical evaluation as soon as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: A small amount of blood in the stools every day can lead to severe blood loss (severe anemia) with serious complications.

            Black tarry stools may indicate a hemorrhage from an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum. It is important to stop the bleeding and to rule out cancer as a cause.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                When an ulcer in the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) erodes into a blood vessel, hemorrhaging will occur. If the vessel is small, the blood loss may only be a trickle, but if the vessel is large, the bleeding will be brisk and life-threatening.
            </p>

            <p>
                Bleeding a little from small vessels in the stomach or duodenum may go unnoticed. The blood can be spread out through the twenty feet of small bowel and the five to six feet of large bowel (the colon). This bleeding can be detected by conducting a fecal occult blood test, wherein a small amount of stool is placed on a special test card, which will change color if blood is present.
            </p>

            <p>
                Blood originating from the stomach or duodenum often turns pitch black from chemicals (enzymes) in the small bowel. The stools can also take on a tarry consistency, especially if the bleeding is rapid. Belly pain caused by an ulcer may lessen when bleeding occurs because blood at the ulcer site coats the sore and protects it from the acid of the stomach. Nausea and vomiting are often not present unless there is a rapid flow of blood in the stomach.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are other important warning signals of blood loss. You may become very weak from a low blood count (anemia) and, if the volume of blood loss is severe, standing up may make you feel weak and light-headed. Also, your blood pressure will drop and your pulse will rise. Under these circumstances death can occur rapidly unless emergency treatment is instituted.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have vomited blood, even if it only happened once and you otherwise feel fine, do not be complacent. Keep track of your pulse; if it is rapid (around 100 beats per minute), you must take immediate action. The pulse is the most sensitive measure of rapid blood loss, and if it is above 90, or higher than your normal pulse, emergency medical assistance is needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                The safest approach is to always seek immediate medical evaluation and treatment when you first note that you are passing black tarry stools.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: You may get black, but not tarry stools from taking iron supplements or Pepto-Bismol, but the stools should return to their normal color within a day if you stop taking either product.

            The passage of pale, putty-colored stools can be due to the blockage of substances normally secreted by the liver into the intestine.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Stools are normally dark, light brown, or green in color. If your stools become pale clay or putty-colored, it means that there is a lack of bile (the substance that provides the normal pigment in stools) passing through the bile duct from the liver to the intestines. This indicates a blockage of the bile duct that can mean that you have liver disease, or that a gallstone or tumor is blocking the bile duct.
            </p>

            <p>
                You should report this finding to your doctor as soon as possible, so that appropriate evaluation and treatment can be instituted. There is a potential for developing serious complications, including permanent liver damage.
