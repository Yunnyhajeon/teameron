Keep the infantâ€™s airway open with a slight tilt and look toward the chest for chest rise, feel for breath on your cheek, and listen for sounds of breathing. If the infant is not breathing on his or her own, immediately begin CPR: thirty compressions followed by two breaths. (See the following CPR guidelines.)</li>

                <b>*Special note:</b> Remember when alone with a child or infant it is always best to initiate two minutes of care before calling 911. If there are any bystanders, have them contact 911 while you begin care.

               <p><b>Choking Prevention in Children</b></p>
The best way to save a child from choking is to avoid it altogether. In general, children under three years old are the most at risk. Within this age range, children between nine months and two years are particularly prone to choking. At this stage, they are increasingly mobile and very likely to put items in their mouth, but are not yet responsive to your commands. Supervise your child well, and keep small items out of reach. Check under furniture and between cushions for small items (such as pen/marker caps, thumbtacks, etc.) that children could find and put in their mouths. Also supervise the actions of older children (such as siblings) who may give a younger child an object that poses a choking threat.
 
            </p>

            <p>When choosing playthings for small children, be sure to follow the age recommendations on the toy packages. Also, think carefully before giving your child certain foods, and supervise infants and young children at mealtime. Do not allow them to run, play, or lie down with food in their mouths.</p>

                <b>Toys and Household Objects with Particular Risks</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Balloons:</b> Balloons are the most common cause of fatalities from choking. Always supervise children under the age of six when playing with balloons. Use Mylar, not latex, balloons, and make sure to dispose of broken pieces of balloons immediately. Note: Balloons pose a choking risk to children of any age.</li>
