            Learn to recognize the chest discomfort of a heart attack. Emergency medical care can save your life.

                Your heart requires nourishment from blood that travels in three small but vital vessels on the surface of your heart. If one of these vessels becomes blocked by a blood clot (thrombus) forming at an area that has been narrowed by a cholesterol plaque, part of your heart muscle will be damaged. This process is a heart attack, and immediate emergency care is necessary since your heart may go into spasm and stop.

                The pain and tightness of a heart attack occurs classically in the center or left side of the chest under the breastbone, and may extend into the right or left arm. Common variations include pain near the front base of the neck, or in the jaw (see Figure 5). Jaw pain sometimes may be felt as pain in the lower teeth. In some cases, the pain may instead appear across the entire chest or between the shoulder blades.

                The character of the chest pain can be crushing or pressure-like, and is often described as a constricting or squeezing feeling. It can also resemble indigestion, and feel as though belching will make it go away. Or it may feel like a tingling or burning sensation. The severity of the pain does  not correlate with the severity of the heart attack; mild or even slight pain can mean a severe heart attack. Some heart attacks are actually pain free, especially in women, diabetics, or senior citizens.

                Intermittent pain, lasting usually twenty minutes or less, may be a symptom of angina, particularly if it occurs with activity and is relieved by rest (see Tip 76 for the explanation of angina), but if the pain lasts for thirty minutes continuously, you are more than likely having a full-blown heart attack. Other important symptoms include breaking out in a cold sweat, extreme weakness, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, feeling faint, and/or shortness of breath.

                If treatment is started early enough (the sooner the better, especially if within hours), the doctor may be able to prevent damage to the heart. He or she may use any of a number of procedures, including dissolving the clot (clot busters), inserting a ballooning catheter to open the blood vessel, using a device called a stent to prop the blood vessel open, etc. (see Figure 6). If surgery to bypass the blocked blood vessel is necessary, the surgeon will attach a vein from your leg or an artery from your chest muscle to the blocked vessel above and below the blockage so that blood can flow around it. Sometimes treatment involves only the use of medicines. (Also see Appendix C, for information on heart disease screening.)
