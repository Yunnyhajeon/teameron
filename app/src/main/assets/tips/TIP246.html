                        Ask the nurse who is administering your medication to identify each medicine you are being given. Remember the appearance of each one, even if you have to write it down. If you are offered something that looks different from what you have previously been given, ask what it is. Bear in mind that there are some situations with generic medications where the same medicine comes in a different shape or color. If your prescriptions have been changed, ask why. Learn about all of your medications, why you are taking them, what drugs or foods they should not be taken with, when they should be taken (with or without meals), and what the potential side effects are. Errors relating to medication are the most frequent mistakes made in the hospital. The consequences of taking the wrong medicine can be very serious. Note: Be sure that everyone treating you knows about any allergies you have to medications (see Tips 169, 170, and 171).
