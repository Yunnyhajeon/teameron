            Unexplained gradual or sudden hearing loss in one ear, with a sense that the room is spinning around, and/or
            ringing in the ear may be an indication of a tumor of the nerve responsible for hearing or another problem
            near this nerve.

                Hearing loss due to aging is a common, gradual process, which is often hardly noticed until someone else
                points it out. Another common source of hearing loss—noise exposure— is also gradual and occurs in both
                ears. Other people experience hearing loss because of their genetic inheritance.

                But what about the loss of hearing in one ear that is accompanied by a feeling that the room is spinning
                around, and/or a ringing in the ear? A rare but serious illness that can cause these symptoms is a tumor
                of the hearing nerve (or near this nerve). Urgent medical evaluation is needed.

                Another more common cause of hearing loss and this type of dizziness is an inflammation of the hearing
                apparatus in the ear. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent permanent damage. Another cause of these
                symptoms may be Ménière’s disease. Even though the cause of these symptoms is sometimes not found, there
                may still be effective treatments, so it is important to see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.
