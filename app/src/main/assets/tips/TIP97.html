            A common, often curable, cause of recurrent ulcers of the stomach and duodenum is infection of their lining by a germ called H. pylori. The red light warning signals of this type of infection are episodes of upper-middle belly pain, with or without vomiting blood and/or passing black tarry stools.

                For many years it was thought that stress caused ulcers. Relieve the stress, and the ulcer would heal, only to come again when the stress level was again increased. This is no longer considered totally correct.
            </p>
<p>
                The exact effect of stress on the development of ulcers has not been determined, but it is now known that a common cause of recurrent ulcers of the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is infection by a microscopic, rod-shaped germ called <i>Helicobacter pylori.</i> This discovery has, in many ways, revolutionized the treatment of ulcers. Antibiotics will eradicate the bacteria and prevent ulcers. Typically, the use of at least two antibiotics simultaneously, in addition to the medication used to shut off the acid in the stomach, treats the infection, achieves ulcer healing, and stops additional ulcers from forming.

                Yet major questions arise. If an ulcer is caused by an infection, where did the infection come from, and how can you protect yourself from getting it again? At the present time, we have no definite answers to these questions. H. pylori occurs worldwide and is apparently acquired from the intake of contaminated food or water. But it is not known how to detect food contamination or how to kill the germ when preparing food. It is possible that it can be transmitted from one person to another within a household.

                A doctor can determine if you have ulcers caused by H. pylori by looking into your stomach and duodenum with a special tube called a gastroscope. He or she will obtain a piece of the stomach lining (a biopsy) and will examine it for the H. pylori germs. In addition, there is a test that uses breath analysis to detect a by-product of the infection and, more recently, a blood test and stool test have been developed to detect the presence of the germ.

                Of course, if you have an ulcer with heartburn (the backup of stomach acid into the esophagus), you should continue to avoid foods that cause these symptoms.

                Ulceration can lead to serious hemorrhage as well as rupture of the stomach or duodenum, so it is very important to be evaluated and treated for this condition as soon as possible. If you are vomiting blood or passing black tarry stools, you should be seen on an emergency basis.
            </p>
<p>
                Persons with H. pylori are at increased risk of developing certain cancers: possibly an adenocarcinoma and definitely a MALT lymphoma.
