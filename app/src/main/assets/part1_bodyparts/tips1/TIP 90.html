            If your pulse drops below 50 beats per minute, there may be a serious impairment in your heartâ€™s pacing system that could cause serious symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, or sudden loss of consciousness. Although some well-conditioned athletes may  normally have a resting pulse below 50, a pulse lower than 40 in an athlete is a reason to seek medical attention  immediately.
