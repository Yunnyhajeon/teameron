            If your child is drinking much more than normal, passing a lot of urine, and/or losing weight, you should get him or her tested to exclude diabetes mellitus. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve his or her overall long-term health.

                Many children with diabetes mellitus are not diagnosed until they go into a coma and develop a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. In retrospect most parents of newly diagnosed diabetics realize that their child has not been “right” for weeks or even months, often displaying symptoms of weight loss, low energy, and excessive thirst.
            </p>

                Parents who notice these symptoms in their child should take the child for a checkup as soon as possible, especially if there is a family history of diabetes. Any child who has previously been dry at night but then starts bed-wetting should have his or her urine checked for diabetes. If the diagnosis is diabetes, the careful control of the child’s blood sugar (with diet and insulin injections) can decrease the risk that he or she will develop the complications of diabetes.
