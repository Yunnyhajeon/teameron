                If you have spent lots of time in the sun, and have developed a round, pearly bump on your face, you may have a skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma. The face, like other areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, is a common site for this type of tumor. Basal cell cancers are usually slow-growing and do not spread, but there are exceptions. Basal cell carcinomas are most often diagnosed in people forty years of age and older. However, they can also be found in people as young as in their twenties. Albinos are particularly at risk of getting this skin condition.

                A diagnosis is made when your doctor cuts off a slice of the bump and inspects it under a microscope. Surgical removal can usually cure this condition. If you suspect you may have skin cancer, do not wait. See your physician early.
