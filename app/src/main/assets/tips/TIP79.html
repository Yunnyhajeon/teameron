            A sudden sharp pain on the side of your chest with shortness of breath may indicate a collapsed lung
            (pneumothorax). This and some other causes of these symptoms (see Tip 61) require emergency treatment.

                When you breathe in, your lungs are full of air, and they still contain air when you breathe out. If
                there is a leak of air from the surface of the lung into the chest cavity, this leaked air can collapse
                the lung. If this happens, you will experience a sudden, sharp pain on the side of your chest, followed
                by shortness of breath.
            </p>

                A common cause of a collapsed lung is the rupture of a small balloon-like weakened area on the lungâ€™s
                surface (called a bleb). You may be born with such a weak spot, but it usually will not rupture until
                late adolescence or early adulthood. This occurs most commonly in tall, thin young men, particularly
                during exertion. Recurrence is frequent because those who have one weak spot on the lung often have
                many.

            <p>
                Alternatively, a smoker who has emphysema might experience this kind of rupture. It can also occur if
                the chest wall is punctured, such as in an accident. Air gets into the chest cavity, which presses on
                and then collapses the lung.
            </p>
            <p>
                A collapsed lung constitutes a medical emergency, especially if the remaining lung is diseased. If the
                other organs in the chest, including the heart and major blood vessels, shift their position because of
                the collapsed lung, they may encroach on the remaining lung. Emergency treatment is necessary to
                re-expand the collapsed lung because this condition can compromise the function of the other lung,
                leading to an inability to breathe and, consequently, death.
