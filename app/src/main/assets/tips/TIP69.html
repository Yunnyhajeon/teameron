            Coughing up blood may be a sign of bronchitis, pneumonia, blood clots, or cancer.

                If you are coughing up blood, it is important to find out where it is originating. The bleeding may have
                an innocuous sourceâ€”a small amount of blood from bleeding gums, a nosebleed, or a cut on your mouth may
                be trickling down and irritating your throat, causing you to cough it up. Or it may actually be
                originating in your lungs, which suggests the presence of blood clots or various infections, including
                tuberculosis. Also, you may have an abnormal growth in your lungs, possibly cancer.

                You need to see a doctor immediately for evaluation and appropriate therapy. A thorough examination of
                your mouth and nose may help determine the cause of the bleeding. Alternatively, the doctor may need to
                look into your lungs with a tube, by taking an X-ray of your lungs, or by scanning them.
