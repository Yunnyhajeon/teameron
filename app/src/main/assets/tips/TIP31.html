            A sore inside of the mouth, on the tongue, or in the throat that does not heal may be cancer. White spots in these areas may also be an early sign of cancer.

                A sore inside of the mouth, on the tongue, or in the throat that does not heal within three weeks is considered cancer until proven otherwise. Many of these early cancers first appear as red sores in the mouth (called erythroplasia). White spots (called leukoplakia), which can be found in the same locations, are also potentially precancerous. Though leukoplakia are more common, erythroplasia are more likely to become cancerous.

                Leukoplakia can result from the abrasive contact of the mouthâ€™s lining with the rough edge of a tooth or denture, but are more commonly caused by the use of tobacco or alcohol. These substances are very irritating to surface cells in the mouth, and can lead to the formation of leukoplakia. If this overgrowth continues, it can evolve into cancer, which can then spread to other parts of the body. An ear, nose, and throat specialist or a dental surgeon is the best specialist to evaluate both types of sores. Make an appointment as soon as possible.

                Another cause of white spots in the mouth is a yeast infection. Yeast infections in the mouths of babies are common because babies have youthful immune systems. They can also occur in the mouths of adults with an abnormally weak immune system caused by diseases such as HIV infection. Additionally, yeast infections can appear as a side effect from taking antibiotics or steroids. For example, they can occur after the prolonged daily use of inhaled corticosteroid inhalers for asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or emphysema (Asthmacort, Advair, etc.). If they persist, these white spots warrant evaluation.
