            <b>D = Defibrillation</b>
            <p>
                AEDs are to be used on adults and children over 1 year of age. The AED should not be used on an infant younger than 1 year of age. Note: If an AED is put on someone who does not need to be shocked, then it will not shock.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>You cannot hurt someone with an AED!</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The purpose of an AED is to analyze the heartbeat of the victim and shock the heart if needed.</li>
                    <li>All AEDs look different; they come in different shapes, sizes, and colors, but as long as you can get your hands on the AED and turn it on, you will be able to figure it out. All AEDs have some type of voice or visual prompts.</li>
                    <li>Once the AED arrives, bare the chest of the victim and turn the machine on. Do not stop providing CPR until the AED is in position and turned on.</li>
                    <li>Follow the voice and/or visual prompts to attach the pads and begin analysis.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Positioning of AED pads:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                For adults, place one pad high on the right side of the chest and the other on the back at the same level. If unable to move the victim, place one pad on the right side of the chest and the other low on the left over the ribs. For children, one pad should be placed on the front of the chest, and the other on the back. The purpose of each of these positionings is to sandwich the heart in between the pads.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are directions for special circumstances when placing the AED pads:
                 <ul>
                            <li>Hairy chest—Use the razor in the pouch attached to the AED to shave the area, and then apply the pads.</li>
                            <li>Water—If the victim is lying in water, move them out of the water.</li>
                            <li>Use a towel or whatever you have available to quickly dry the chest, then apply the pads.</li>
                            <li>Implanted device—A lump will be under the skin on the left or right side of the chest. If the device is on the right side (which is where one of the pads should be placed), place the pad one inch from the device and not directly on top of the device.</li>
                            <li>Medication patches—If there is a patch on the victim’s chest, remove it and wipe the area quickly before you place the pads on the chest.</li>
                </ul>
