            Adolescents or young adults who experience headaches that get progressively more severe over a few days or longer, along with visual changes, may have a rare but treatable condition in which the pressure on the brain is increased. While not usually life threatening, it can cause serious complications such as a permanent loss of vision.

                This condition, known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is most common in adolescent girls. Usually the cause is unknown, but it may occasionally be the result of factors such as a hormonal imbalance, a drug side effect (for example, it could be caused by tetracycline and/or other medicines used for adolescent skin conditions), high doses of vitamin A, or obesity. Frequently no specific origin can be found.

                The first step toward diagnosis is a brain scan, as this will help exclude other causes of increased pressure of the fluid around the brain, such as a tumor. If the scan is negative, a spinal tap can be used to detect when there is very high pressure of the fluid on the brain. This condition is important to diagnose because it may cause symptoms similar to a brain tumor but has a much better outcome. See your doctor as soon as possible for assessment and possible referral to a neurologist (brain specialist).
