            Severe back and, in certain cases, leg pain, especially when accompanied by a fever, may mean you have a serious infection rather than a backbone problem such as a disk herniation or spur. If the pain is caused by an infection, often the lower back will be tender to the touch. Senior citizens and/or debilitated people are more vulnerable to these massive infections.
