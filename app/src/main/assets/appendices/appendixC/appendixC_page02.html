                Important note: There are certain situations when one experiences very common signs or symptoms, and a simple and inexpensive screening test might help identify a rare but serious problem. Subsequently, the serious illness can then be treated early enough to save the personâ€™s life. An example of this is somebody who is experiencing fatigue, lingering infections, excessive bruising or bleeding, and/or swollen gums. A simple blood test, the CBC (complete blood count), identifies the specific kinds of white blood cells and the red blood cell count. An abnormal result from this simple test in a person with any of the above symptoms might trigger an extensive evaluation resulting in an early diagnosis of leukemia. Unfortunately, people with this disorder are frequently diagnosed too late to receive effective treatment when it will have the greatest benefit.

            <p><b>Vision</b></p>
            <p>
                Consider going to an eye doctor for an eye exam at least twice between the ages of thirty and forty, or any time you think your vision may be declining. People who use glasses, contacts, or other vision correctors should get their vision retested every year. Also, if you are taking any medications or have a chronic disease such as diabetes or hypertension, you should ask your primary care doctor how often you should see an ophthalmologist.
            </p>
            <p>
Note: An ophthalmologist is not the same as an optometrist. An optometrist fits people for glasses and contact lenses, as well as tests for vision and performs many other evaluations of the eye. He or she is also well trained in many other activities relating to eye care. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who has extensive training in surgery of the eye, and the medical evaluation and treatment of eye diseases.
            </p>

            <p><b>Glaucoma</b></p>
            <p>
Many eye doctors recommend that everyone, even if they have no risk factors, be screened once a year after the age of fifty for glaucoma (a condition of increased pressure in the eyes). Risk factors for glaucoma include nearsightedness, a family history of glaucoma, African-American ethnicity, and/or a history of trauma to an eye. Note: Although glaucoma is far more prevalent in older people, it can even appear in kids. The testing can be done easily and painlessly by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.
