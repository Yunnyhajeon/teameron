            If you have a family history of crib death [also known as SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome)], or an infant who has had "near-miss crib death," you can take some simple measures to dramatically reduce the risk of a recurrence.

<p>
                In developed countries, SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) or crib death is still the most common cause of death in babies age one month to one year. Most cases occur in babies under six months of age. The incidence has decreased dramatically since the public education campaigns of the early 1990s on the sleeping positions of babies.

            </p>
<p>
                The following babies are especially at risk:
                <ul>
<li>Premature and low-birth-weight babies</li>
<li>Twins, triplets, etc. (multiple pregnancies)</li>
<li>Babies from a lower socioeconomic status</li>
<li>Babies in households where anyone smokes, especially the mother. This risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked; for every additional ten cigarettes per day, the risk of crib death increases threefold.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                In order to reduce your baby’s risk of crib death:
                <ul>
<li>Do not smoke during pregnancy, or permit anyone to smoke in your household after the birth of your baby.</li>
<li>Put your baby to sleep on his or her back. If the baby has reflux (a spitting baby), tilt the baby on his or her left side to prevent fluid from regurgitating into his or her lungs (aspiration). Once your baby is old enough to roll over, this is irrelevant.</li>
<li>Do not overdress your baby or use too much bedding, especially if the baby is already warm. Use only one thin blanket if needed. Tuck it in so it cannot cover the baby’s head. A blanket sleeper or warm sleeping garment is an alternative in a cold environment.</li>
<li>Never put your baby on a water bed, sheepskins, or very soft bedding material.</li>
<li>Select a crib that conforms to Consumer Product Safety Commission recommendations and has a firm and snug-fitting mattress.</li>
<li>Never leave stuffed animals in the crib while your baby is sleeping.</li>
<li>Breastfeed your baby for at least six months if possible (of course, there are other advantages of breast-feeding for six months or more).</li>
<li>If you think your baby is sick, contact your doctor.</li>
<li>Learn simple cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) methods. (See Appendix A.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                A baby is generally diagnosed as having died of SIDS if no specific cause of death is found.
