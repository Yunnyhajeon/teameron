            If one of your eyelids droops, you’re seeing double, and/or your pupils are unequal in size, you may have a
            ballooning blood vessel (aneurysm) in your brain that could burst. Other causes could include nerve damage
            or possibly a brain tumor.

                An eyelid that does not move normally, pupils that are unequal in size, and/or seeing double may
                indicate that the nerves controlling these functions are not transmitting impulses normally (see Figure
                2). Any abnormality in the brain or surrounding structures that puts pressure on these nerves can cause
                the above symptoms. For example, a blood vessel that is ballooning out (aneurysm) at a specific location
                could press on these nerves. If this is the case, you need emergency medical evaluation—brain surgery
                may be required to prevent the blood vessel from bursting.

                If one eyelid droops and the pupil of the same eye is smaller than the other, it may be evidence of a
                condition called Horner’s syndrome, which means that a very specific nerve is being damaged. These
                symptoms are a major cause for concern if they are accompanied by a lack of sweating or flushing on that
                same side of your face.

                Alternatively, your symptoms could also be caused by a tumor or a defective artery in the neck that
                causes damage to a specific nerve that affects only one side of the face.
            </p>
            <p>
                In any of these situations, you need to seek immediate medical evaluation.
