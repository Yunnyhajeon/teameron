                Standing too long causes swelling of the ankles, especially if you are overweight or pregnant. If this is the cause, the swelling is not significant and should clear after a night of rest. On the other hand, lower leg swelling may be an important sign of a serious disease, including inflamed or blocked varicose veins. It may indicate that you have heart, liver, or kidney disease; a low-functioning thyroid gland; or cancer elsewhere in your body. Alternatively, it may appear as a side effect of a medication.

                You can determine the severity of the swelling with a simple test: The first step is to be up and about (out of bed for at least an hour). Next, while standing, press your thumb firmly over your shinbone for five to ten seconds, then release it. If the imprint of the thumb remains, significant swelling is present. The deeper the pit, the worse the swelling. If the swelling does not disappear after one night of rest or leg elevation, it is important to seek medical evaluation.
