<p>If your child has recurrent wheezing, especially when he or she gets a cold, or a recurrent nighttime cough, he/she may have asthma and should be assessed and started on appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Note: In rare cases, the wheezing may be caused by a foreign object lodged in the airway which requires urgent medical evaluation. If the child cannot speak and is clearly choking, you need to attempt to get the object out. (See Appendix A for instruction).

<p>Asthma is an allergic or inflammatory condition. Certain triggers cause the small “air pipes” in the lungs to become inflamed and narrowed, making breathing more difficult and causing the individual to wheeze, cough, and, if severe, even struggle for breath. Some common triggers are sudden exposure to cold air, secondhand smoke, cats, dogs, dust mites, cockroaches, and exercise. Days with high ozone levels are also unhealthy for asthmatics; outdoor time should be limited when the air quality is bad. The morning news (both on television and radio) often gives reports on air quality. The daily Air Quality Index can also be found online and on the Weather Channel.

                Asthma is increasingly common, with many cases occurring in families with no previous history of it. Sometimes the child’s only symptom is a recurrent nighttime cough, and the diagnosis of asthma may be delayed, which could have serious consequences. Do not use over-the-counter cough syrups or over-the-counter bronchodilators (like Primatene Mist) if your child has asthma, unless prescribed by his or her pediatrician. In children with asthma, coughing is usually related to early wheezing.

                Asthma is a variable condition, and most children have mild disorders that are easily treatable, usually with inhaled medicine. Many will “grow out of it.” Some children, however, will experience severe life-threatening attacks. So get your child assessed by a doctor as soon as possible for appropriate treatment, and learn to avoid the specific “triggers” of his or her asthma attack (see Tips 57 and 212 for more information on asthma attacks). If your child has asthma and is over five years of age, ask his/her doctor about having your child’s breathing tested on a breathing machine called a spirometer, which measures respiratory gases. Also, do not allow anyone to smoke around your child.
