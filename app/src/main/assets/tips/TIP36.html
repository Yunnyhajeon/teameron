            Epiglottitis can block your airway. If you are gasping with a “seal-like” noise, often associated with   a severe sore throat, you need to be seen by a doctor on an emergency basis.

<p>
                Epiglottitis is an infection of the epiglottis (the flap over the windpipe that stops food from getting into the lungs when you swallow). It causes the epiglottis to swell, blocking the airway. An important warning sign of a potential life-threatening case of epiglottitis is drooling and/or the presence of noisy breathing.
            </p>
<p>
                When your condition gets much worse, there are depressed areas at the neck base, just above the breastbone, and in the spaces between the ribs. If these areas are noticeably sucked in when you inhale, it is possible that negative pressure in the chest cavity is being created by a significant blockage of the airway.

                If you are experiencing noisy breathing or are struggling to inhale, you may be having difficulty getting air into your lungs.

                Call for an ambulance (911 in most locations). You need emergency care. (See Tip 210 for information on epiglottitis in babies and children.)
