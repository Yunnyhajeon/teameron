            A deep, aching pain that starts in the lower back or buttocks and travels down the back of the leg can be due to the irritation of one of the nerves in the spine. If left untreated for many weeks or months, the compression of the nerve root can lead to nerve damage, causing permanent weakness, numbness, or even regional paralysis.
