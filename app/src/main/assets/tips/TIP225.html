<p>
                Children with Sturge-Weber syndrome have a red, flat birth-mark covering one third of their face. There is an underlying abnormality, usually in the back area of the brain, on the same side. It may result in epilepsy, mental retardation, and/or a stroke (which will affect the opposite side of the body). Expert neurological (nerve) and ophthalmological (eye) assessment and care are needed to prevent or treat possible complications associated with this disorder. The condition is not known to be inherited.
