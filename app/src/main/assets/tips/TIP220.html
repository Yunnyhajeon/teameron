            Dehydration or other complications due to excessive loss of fluid needs to be avoided in a baby or child who has diarrhea and/or vomiting. It can be life-threatening.
        </div>
<div class="body_contents">
<p>
                Diarrhea and vomiting are both common problems in babies and infants. Dehydration can occur rapidly, especially if the infant also has a fever.
            </p>
<p>
                If your child has diarrhea and/or vomiting and any of the following symptoms, you should get him or her to the emergency room.
                <ul>
<li>Frequent vomiting if the baby is under three months of age. Some doctors suggest that “frequent” means more than three times in four hours, but it could be less often, depending on the severity of the vomiting.</li>
<li>Signs of dehydration:
                        <ul>
<li>excessive drowsiness or irritability, or limpness</li>
<li>sunken eyes and sunken fontanel (soft spot on the head)</li>
<li>loose, dry skin</li>
<li>dry mouth and tongue</li>
<li>very little, dark-colored urine (less than three wet diapers in twenty-four hours)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Persistent belly pain</li>
<li>Very forceful, recurrent vomiting (projectile), in a baby; green or bloody vomit</li>
<li>Blood in the stools (small streaks without any other signs or symptoms are not an emergency, but warrant contacting the child’s doctor)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                In children over six months, dehydration may be prevented by giving oral solutions such as Pedialyte. Consult with the child’s physician before giving these solutions to babies younger than six months of age, since they do not have the important nourishment that a baby needs. You may be able to continue giving breast milk or formula. They are best when given in small volumes at frequent intervals, and they can be very effective. If your child is still vomiting occasionally, you may have to give him/her as little as a teaspoon at a time.  Solutions that contain a high sodium content, such as Rehydralyte, should only be given to a child (of any age) on the advice of a physician.
            </p>
<p>
                Viruses are the most common cause of diarrhea in children. Babies who are exclusively breast-fed until they are six months of age very rarely get significant diarrhea. Eating undercooked ground beef and unwashed vegetables increases the risk for dangerous E. coli diarrhea.
            </p>
<p>
                If your child has vomiting or diarrhea, ask a physician how much regular food and how much of these rehydration solutions are appropriate for him or her.
