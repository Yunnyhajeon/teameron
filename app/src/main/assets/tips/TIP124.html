                There are many reasons that you may pass blood from the rectum, but bright red blood that appears on your toilet tissue could be a sign of colon cancer. Detecting this cancer early could save your life. Colon cancer is one of the more common cancers. The thought that “It’s only hemorrhoids” has put a lot of colon cancer victims in early graves. Remember, even if you have hemorrhoids, the rectal bleeding could also be from cancer; rectal bleeding should be considered a sign of cancer until proven otherwise.

                Blood passing through the rectum can originate from anywhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth all the way to the anus. Possible sources of this blood are irritation and ulcers in the mouth, stomach, or intestines, as well as cancer in any of these areas. Even swallowing blood from a nose-bleed can cause it to appear in your bowel movements. Usually the darker the blood, the higher up the bleeding site is in the GI tract. The stools can become black and tarry if the bleeding site is high enough. Sometimes the stools will look normal if there is a small amount of bleeding or if the blood has been absorbed into the rest of the body from the GI tract.

                There are a number of procedures your doctor can perform to detect whether you are bleeding, and if so, where. A sigmoidoscope (a tube with a miniature video camera attached) can be passed into the anus to examine sections of the large intestine, and a colonoscope can be used to reach ALL of the large intestine (colon). Though these procedures sound intimidating, they are not nearly as uncomfortable as they might seem. An FOB (fecal occult blood) test—conducted by placing fecal material on a special card—detects blood in the stool that is not visible to the naked eye. A positive fecal occult blood test may indicate cancer or other less serious conditions such as hemorrhoids.

                Also, when you bleed from the GI tract, you can develop anemia (a low blood count). This is a tip-off that you may have cancer of the colon, although there are many other reasons why you may have a low blood count.

                If you have a close relative who has had colon cancer, a family history of colon polyps, a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, or a personal history of ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease, you are at a greater risk for developing colon cancer. If this is the case, you should establish a program of routine colonoscopy, even if you are young and do not have any symptoms. Whether you have a family history or not, routine screening exams every five years and checking for microscopic amounts of blood in the stool every year may be life-saving. Colon cancer screening should begin no later than age fifty. Many doctors recommend that if you have a family history, you should get screened ten years earlier than the age your family member was diagnosed. For example, if your mother was diagnosed at age forty, you should start getting screened at age thirty. (Also see Appendix C, about early detection of cancer in the GI tract.) Early detection without any warning signs can lead to a cure; remember, this disease is not rare!

                If you pass red or dark blood in your bowel movement, seek medical evaluation as soon as possible.

                Note: A small amount of blood in the stools every day can lead to severe blood loss (severe anemia) with serious complications.
