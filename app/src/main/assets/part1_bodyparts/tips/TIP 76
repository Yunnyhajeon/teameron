            If you experience episodes of chest pain, tightness, and burning that extend to the neck, throat, jaw, and/or left shoulder and upper arm, usually lasting less than twenty minutes, you may be experiencing angina. This discomfort often occurs with exertion, but sometimes occurs during rest or sleep. It is often a precursor to a heart attack and needs immediate evaluation and treatment.
