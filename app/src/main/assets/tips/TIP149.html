            Changes in your pattern of bruising, little black or red dots on your skin (which may look like pin-size bleeding spots), nosebleeds, gum bleeds, rectal bleeds, or bleeding too long after a cut are all indications that you may have blood-clotting problems from an ailment or as the side effect of a medication (such as aspirin or other pain pills).

                Blood clotting requires a cascade of many different chemical reactions. If anything interferes with this cascade of reactions, your blood may not clot normally. For example, certain clotting substances are made in the liver, so if you have a liver ailment, you may bleed more easily. Also, hemophiliacs are born without a specific clotting factor and need to be given a replacement for it.

                Particles in your blood called platelets prevent blood from leaking out of the capillaries, your tiny blood vessels. Platelets also release chemicals that aid in the clotting process, so if you begin to bruise or bleed easily, it could be the result of a low platelet level. This latter condition might be a side effect of a medication you are taking or the result of a disease that destroys platelets, such as an enlarged spleen or hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is more commonly seen in children. (SeeTip 214.)

                These symptoms require immediate medical attention, since it places you at a higher risk of bleeding in your brain (a stroke) or bleeding internally at some other site in your body.
