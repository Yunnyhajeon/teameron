            The symptom of a severe sore throat may lead to a throat infection that can close off your airway and cause you to strangle. Though this is rare, you need to watch out for any signs of infection.

                Three major kinds of infection can endanger the airway: a pus pocket around the tonsils (peritonsillar abscess); an infection in the floor of the mouth, which spreads throughout the jaw and around the teeth (Ludwigâ€™s angina); and an infection of the epiglottis (the flap over your windpipe that keeps food from entering). You can prevent these infections by seeking treatment for your sore throat before it worsens.

                Since sore throats are so common, how do you know when you may be in danger? Make sure your condition improves over a forty-eight-hour period. Never let it go longer before seeking medical attention. You might even want to get help earlier if your sore throat sets in after a dental procedure; your condition is more dangerous in this scenario because it can spread faster.

                It is <i>always</i> an emergency if you experience hardness or swelling in the floor of your mouth and around the base of your tongue, if you have difficulty opening your mouth, or if you notice saliva drooling from your mouth. Also, more serious throat infections are often much worse if they occur on one side of your throat. When you open your mouth and look in the mirror, if the dangling skin hanging in the back of your throat (the uvula) shifts to one side rather than pointing downward, go to your doctor or the emergency room.

                Keep aware of your symptoms, because it is possible for your sore throat to improve after receiving antibiotics, only to later become worse. Without you knowing it, germs may be digging deeper into the tissues of your throat and setting up an abscess (pus pocket) that bulges into your airway, narrowing it. At this point the pain will usually increase and your fever will become higher, thus indicating that you need further medical treatment.

                Note: Occasionally a sore throat that does not respond to treatment after a number of weeks is caused by a tumor located deep within the throat.  These tumors can only be seen when the doctor uses a special small mirror or camera to look into your mouth.
