                This is the classic pain pattern of a dissecting aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. The thoracic aorta, the
                huge artery where blood flows from the heart, is the main thoroughfare in the distribution of blood to
                all parts of the body. The aortic wall is made up of three layers and is constantly subjected to
                pulsating pressure from the heartbeat, especially when your blood pressure is too high. This kind of
                stress can weaken and tear the inner layer of the aortic wall, allowing blood to work its way into the
                wall itself. This will cause the layers to separate in a process called dissection. An aneurysm occurs
                when the weakened wall of the heart balloons out. This constitutes a true medical emergencyâ€”you need to
                be taken to an emergency room as quickly as possible. If the aneurysm ruptures through the outer wall of
                the aorta, massive bleeding and death will follow. Note: There are inherited disorders that increase
                your chance of having an aortic aneurysm. If you have a family member who has been diagnosed with an
                aortic aneurysm, you need to be evaluated.

                Other possible causes of this type of pain include a stomach ulcer that has broken through the stomach
                wall, pancreatic inflammation, and gallbladder disease. All of these conditions warrant immediate
                medical evaluation.
