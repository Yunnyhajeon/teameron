            If food or drink will not go down when you swallow, or swallowing causes you pain, you may have a partial
            esophagus obstruction that could lead to or be a sign of cancer.

                Difficulty swallowing is a common problem. Most of the time it occurs when eating bulky foods like meat
                or corn bread. You swallow, and it sticks at a narrowed part of the esophagus (the swallowing tube that
                extends from mouth to stomach) before finally going down. You feel the food getting stuck in a region
                underneath the breastbone.

                Narrowing most often occurs in the lower esophagus and is usually the result of stomach acid refluxing
                (backing up) into the lower esophagus, irritating it. If this happens over a long period of time,
                constriction or narrowing of the esophagus occurs too, and more foods get stuck when you swallow. The
                narrowing may be so gradual that you choose to stop eating difficult-to-swallow foods like steak without
                even realizing it. Or you may simply lose weight. At its worst, this condition can progress to the point
                of complete blockage, in which case relieving the obstruction may require emergency treatment.

                A major reason to evaluate this problem early—long before complete blockage occurs—is to prevent the
                development of cancer of the esophagus, which can arise from this type of long-standing irritation. A
                gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in the stomach and colon, can insert a special tube with a
                small video camera into your mouth and down the esophagus. By obtaining and examining a small piece of
                the esophagus through biopsy, he or she can determine whether a long-standing irritation or cancer is
                present.
