            Coughing up dirty-looking phlegm may mean that there is pus in it from an infection.

                When you get a cold or the flu, you usually cough up phlegm. It is important to note the color. Mucus produced by the lungs, airways, nose, and sinuses is usually clear and is often thicker than water. However, mucus is also produced in response to allergies, irritants like cigarette smoke, and illnesses such as a cold and the flu. “Dirty-looking” phlegm (usually gray or green) contains pus cells, which may be coming from a serious lung infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia. When the infection is confined to the air passages, you have bronchitis, and when it invades the substance of the lung, you have pneumonia. These infections may be caused by a number of different germs, including bacteria that require antibiotic treatment or viruses that usually disappear on their own (antibiotic treatment is not effective with viruses). Smokers, diabetics, or people with other serious medical problems often require antibiotics to clear up their dirty phlegm.

                When your phlegm turns dirty, seek medical evaluation and treatment as soon as possible, especially if fever and fatigue are present or if you have other medical ailments. The doctor will determine what type of infection is present and if antibiotic treatment is needed.

                Note: Also be aware that coughing up dirty-looking phlegm could be a result of mucus that has dripped down from a sinus infection.
