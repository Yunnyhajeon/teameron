            If your child has become suddenly ill and is drooling, is unable to open his or her mouth wide, has any decrease in the range of motion in his or her neck, cannot swallow liquids (including his/her own saliva), and/or is having difficulty talking or breathing, take your child to the emergency room immediately. Swelling, possibly caused by an infection, could be blocking the child's throat. Another sign that this is the case is if the child refuses to assume any position besides sitting up and forward. Try to keep the child upright.

<p>
                Children may not want to eat or drink when sick. But when given a pain or fever reducer, they can usually be convinced to swallow small amounts of cool liquids. If your child refuses to take any liquids, even after being given the correct dose of an over-the-counter pain medicine and especially if they exhibit the above symptoms, you should take them to the emergency room immediately.
