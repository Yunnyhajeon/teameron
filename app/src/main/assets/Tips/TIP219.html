            If a child or infant has more than a small amount of blood in his or her stools repeatedly and/or severe cramping during an episode of diarrhea, it increases the chance that the illness is a serious one and will require immediate medical attention.

<p>
                Older children may flush the toilet without observing the nature of a diarrhea stool. They should be asked to look at the stool and show it to an adult if it is abnormal. With the emergence of E. coli as a potentially very dangerous germ, it has become important that parents watch diarrhea carefully (see Tip 220 for more emergency information on diarrhea in babies and children). Large numbers of stools, severe cramping with diarrhea, and blood in the stools should cause parents to seek medical attention.
            </p>

                Remember, when observing the stool, that if the child drinks red liquids or eats beets, the stool may have a red color.
