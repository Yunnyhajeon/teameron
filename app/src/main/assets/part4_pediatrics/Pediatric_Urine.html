            Though it is rare, a child can develop acute kidney failure with a low blood count (anemia) following diarrhea or a respiratory infection. Symptoms of kidney failure include reduced urine output, red or brown urine, drowsiness, irritability, paleness, and tiny "needlepoint" red spots on the skin. Immediate medical management (ideally by a pediatric kidney specialist or nephrologist) is necessary to save the child's life in a case of acute kidney failure.

                Sometimes after bloody diarrhea (particularly when caused by the bacteria E. coli), or more rarely after a respiratory infection, a child may suddenly develop temporary kidney failure and severe anemia. This is called hemolytic uremic syndrome and is more common in children under the age of three. Emergency medical therapy improves the chance for survival and lowers the risk of long-term kidney problems.

            If your child is experiencing an unexplained fever and/or frequent, sometimes painful urination, he or she may have a urinary tract infection. The child may wet his/her pants or bed, even if he or she is potty trained. The urine may also have  a dark color and/or strong smell. The signs and symptoms in a child are subtle, so it is important to be aware of them and take this condition seriously. Recurrent, untreated urinary tract infections in young children are one of the most common causes of kidney failure.

            <p>
                Urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants and young children can be extremely difficult to recognize because the signs and symptoms are usually nonspecific: mild fever, frequent urination (sometimes with pain), and/or urine that smells particularly strong. It can also be difficult to get a clean sample of urine from a small child.
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child has a persistent fever with no other obvious cause (such as a cold or ear infection), you should have his or her urine checked by a doctor as soon as possible. If your preschool child has had a proven UTI, he or she should be thoroughly checked, in order to exclude a condition where the urine refluxes up into the kidney from the bladder. A child who has this problem is at a higher risk of damaging his or her kidneys and needs to be carefully supervised and treated. A delay in diagnosis and treatment can result in permanent kidney damage and high blood pressure later in life. (See also Tip 130.)

            If your child is drinking much more than normal, passing a lot of urine, and/or losing weight, you should get him or her tested to exclude diabetes mellitus. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve his or her overall long-term health.

            <p>
                Many children with diabetes mellitus are not diagnosed until they go into a coma and develop a life-threatening condition called ketoacidosis. In retrospect most parents of newly diagnosed diabetics realize that their child has not been “right” for weeks or even months, often displaying symptoms of weight loss, low energy, and excessive thirst.
            </p>

            <p>
                Parents who notice these symptoms in their child should take the child for a checkup as soon as possible, especially if there is a family history of diabetes. Any child who has previously been dry at night but then starts bed-wetting should have his or her urine checked for diabetes. If the diagnosis is diabetes, the careful control of the child’s blood sugar (with diet and insulin injections) can decrease the risk that he or she will develop the complications of diabetes.
