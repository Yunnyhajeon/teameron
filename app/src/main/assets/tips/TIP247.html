                        Confusion relating to which medications you should take following your discharge from the hospital is a major source of error, especially when multiple doctors have treated you during your hospital stay. Request that your doctor review all the medications you were taking prior to coming to the hospital as well as those you were taking during your hospital stay. You should be given a written list of what you are supposed to take after discharge. Donâ€™t settle for verbal instructions
