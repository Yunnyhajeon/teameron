            A short episode of numbness on one side of your face, with slurred speech, weakness in an arm and/or leg,
            double vision, and/or “vertigo” (an unbalanced feeling), which lasts temporarily (usually minutes to hours),
            is a TIA (transient ischemic attack) if a certain area of the brain is not getting enough blood. Another
            symptom you may experience during a TIA is momentary blindness.

                A TIA is an important red light warning signal of a stroke. When a loose blood clot in the circulation
                gets stuck in a narrow blood vessel traveling to the brain, it will restrict blood flow and cause
                abnormal functioning in the area of the brain that is not getting enough oxygen and nourishment. For
                example, it could create numbness of the face, slurred speech, or weakness in an arm, hand, and/or leg.
                If the blood clot dissolves quickly enough on its own, blood flow will return and the symptoms will
                subside. Note: Rhythm abnormalities of the heart can also cause decreased blood flow to the brain,
                resulting in these symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Persons with these red light warning signals require emergency evaluation and therapy because if the
                next clot is larger or the heart rhythm abnormality lasts too long, the affected brain tissue may be
                further damaged and a stroke may occur. Also, once a TIA has occurred it is more likely to recur unless
                treatment is instituted. (See Appendix C, page 392, for information about stroke prevention.) If TIA
                symptoms develop, do not wait to see if they resolve. Seek immediate emergency care.
            </p>

                Note: You might not be able to tell you are having a TIA (just as epileptics have no recollection of a
                seizure). It may be that only the person observing you can tell you are having a problem.
