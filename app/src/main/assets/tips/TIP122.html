            Bowel movements that occur less often than every three days usually mean you are constipated. Constipation can be a sign of various diseases of the colon, including cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications.

                After digestion is completed in the stomach and small intestine, food residues arrive in the colon. The colon is a muscular, walled tube five to six feet in length. It conserves body water by removing 90 percent of the water from the food residues (fecal material) as they pass through. If the transit time in the colon is too slow, too much water is removed, and the feces become hard. If the transit time is too fast, the fecal material will come out as diarrhea.

                Constipation may be caused by weak muscles in the wall of the colon. Some individuals inherit this trait, while others weaken the muscles of the colon wall by using laxatives so frequently that they become dependent on them. Many medications, including certain ones for pain and blood pressure and those containing iron, can also lead to constipation. More serious potential causes include hypothyroidism (low thyroid gland function), many diseases of the colon, and cancer, all of which need to be tested for by a doctor. Early treatment of the underlying illness can often prevent serious complications.

                Measures to relieve constipation are directed at improving the colonâ€™s ability to propel material through it. For example, increased water consumption helps prevent the fecal material from becoming too hard. Stool softeners also help. Some laxatives stimulate the colon wall to squeeze fecal material through more easily, while others irritate the bowel lining, which prompts the flow of water back into the colon to aid the flow of fecal material. The latter type of laxative is less desirable because it further weakens the bowel wall. The dietary fiber present in vegetables, grain, fruits, and pectin-containing fruit juices like prune juice, or in powder supplements can help facilitate the movement of feces through the colon, as can exercise.

                If you have a bowel movement less often than every three days, or if you have experienced any change in your bowel patterns, see your doctor for an evaluation to determine the underlying cause.
