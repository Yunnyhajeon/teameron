                A small, moist, fingerlike projection in the genital area may be caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). The presence of HPV increases the risk that a woman will develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include having a high number of sexual partners, intercourse at a young age, taking oral contraceptives, not using condoms, smoking, and increasing age.

                It is important to see a physician on a regular basis for a thorough pelvic examination so that any malignant changes can be detected early. The Pap smear is the test used to check for abnormalities of the cervix. (See Appendix C, for details on routine Pap smear screening and HPV vaccinations.)
