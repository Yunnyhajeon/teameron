                            <li><b>Firm fruits or vegetables:</b> Prepare carrots, grapes, apples, pears, and celery appropriately: Peel them, chop them finely, or cook them until soft.</li>

                            <li><b>Chunks of meat, cheese, or peanut butter:</b> Shred or grate any firm cheeses. Spread soft cheese or peanut butter on a cracker or piece of bread. Grind, crumble, or shred meat into small bits before serving to an infant or young child.</li>
                            <li><b>Raisins, prunes, or apricots:</b> Boil any dried fruits so they become soft and easily chewed. Prunes and apricots need to also be cut into smaller pieces.</li>
