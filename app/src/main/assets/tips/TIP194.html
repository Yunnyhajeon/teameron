            If you think you are pregnant (you have missed periods and have a positive pregnancy test), and you experience severe nausea and vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and/or discharge of grapelike particles, seek medical evaluation. These symptoms may be due to a tumorlike growth in your womb, which puts you in danger of hemorrhaging. An early evaluation and therapeutic extraction of the mass can be life-saving. About six percent of these growths are cancerous.

<p>
            A hydatidiform mole is a tumor like mass that can grow in your womb such that you seem to be pregnant. This condition, which occurs in about one out of 1,200 pregnancies, is caused by an abnormal egg implanting in the wall of the womb. The fetal parts (tissue) may or may not be present, but the placenta (the pancake like attachment that normally provides nourishment for the baby) grows rapidly and produces the hormones of pregnancy. Fingerlike projections of the placenta invade the wall of the womb, acting like a cancerous growth. They swell and degenerate, causing you to bleed from the vagina. The projections themselves look like grapes when they pass with the bloody discharge. This condition is known as a molar pregnancy.
            </p>

            If you think you are pregnant but have signs and symptoms suggesting a molar pregnancy, it is important that you seek emergency medical care to have the mass removed from your womb. Not only are you in danger of a life-threatening hemorrhage, but the fingerlike projections of the placenta can also turn cancerous and spread throughout your body.
