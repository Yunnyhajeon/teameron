            Coughing up blood may be a sign of bronchitis, pneumonia, blood clots, or cancer.

                If you are coughing up blood, it is important to find out where it is originating. The bleeding may have an innocuous source—a small amount of blood from bleeding gums, a nosebleed, or a cut on your mouth may be trickling down and irritating your throat, causing you to cough it up. Or it may actually be originating in your lungs, which suggests the presence of blood clots or various infections, including tuberculosis. Also, you may have an abnormal growth in your lungs, possibly cancer.
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to see a doctor immediately for evaluation and appropriate therapy. A thorough examination of your mouth and nose may help determine the cause of the bleeding. Alternatively, the doctor may need to look into your lungs with a tube, by taking an X-ray of your lungs, or by scanning them.

            Coughing up dirty-looking phlegm may mean that there is pus in it from an infection.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                When you get a cold or the flu, you usually cough up phlegm. It is important to note the color. Mucus produced by the lungs, airways, nose, and sinuses is usually clear and is often thicker than water. However, mucus is also produced in response to allergies, irritants like cigarette smoke, and illnesses such as a cold and the flu. “Dirty-looking” phlegm (usually gray or green) contains pus cells, which may be coming from a serious lung infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia. When the infection is confined to the air passages, you have bronchitis, and when it invades the substance of the lung, you have pneumonia. These infections may be caused by a number of different germs, including bacteria that require antibiotic treatment or viruses that usually disappear on their own (antibiotic treatment is not effective with viruses). Smokers, diabetics, or people with other serious medical problems often require antibiotics to clear up their dirty phlegm.
            </p>

            <p>
                When your phlegm turns dirty, seek medical evaluation and treatment as soon as possible, especially if fever and fatigue are present or if you have other medical ailments. The doctor will determine what type of infection is present and if antibiotic treatment is needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: Also be aware that coughing up dirty-looking phlegm could be a result of mucus that has dripped down from a sinus infection.

            A persistent cough lasting more than two weeks may be caused by something as simple as bronchitis or allergies, or by something as serious as tuberculosis, pneumonia, heart disease, or cancer. An annoying chronic cough can also be caused by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus (the tube between the mouth and the stomach). You should be evaluated as soon as possible, especially if you cough up blood, which may then get into the lungs.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Everyone coughs from time to time, whether from postnasal drip, a cold, an allergy, or irritants in the air. Most of these minor illnesses run their course in fourteen days or less. If a cough lasts longer or is associated with additional symptoms, other causes must be considered by a physician. Some of these potential causes are life-threatening; they include lung infection, heart disease, and cancer. Smokers often cough constantly, so they may not realize when a more serious disease is present.
            </p>

            <p>
                If routine treatments for coughs have failed, and more traditional causes have been ruled out, another possibility is reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, which may be associated with a hiatal hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach pokes through a hole in the diaphragm, which separates the chest from the abdomen. This condition can wake you up at night with the feeling that you are strangling. You may cough so hard that it takes your breath away, and you may even black out.
            </p>

            <p>
                A hiatal hernia or other conditions can allow acid-containing fluid to back up the esophagus and then into the windpipe, which irritates the lining and causes repeated coughing episodes. This is called acid reflux. Acidic liquid is able to flow up the esophagus much more easily when you are lying down, so the reflux is usually more troublesome at night. If the cause of your cough is a hiatal hernia, you need to take medication for your stomach problem, not an antibiotic or cold medicine for your cough. It is important to address this problem—if your lungs become soiled by acid over a long period of time, scarring may occur, along with a reduction in lung function.
            </p>

            <p>
                Treatment begins with prescription medicines designed to suppress acid formation in the stomach. Other practical measures are important as well. Before lying down, try to remain upright for two to four hours after eating or drinking. Avoid overeating at any time. Elevate the head of your bed by placing a brick under each leg of the headboard. This will provide enough of an incline to reduce the acid reflux yet not enough to disturb sleep.
            </p>

            <p>
                Long-term coughing may also be the result of a postnasal drip, allergies, or asthma, which need to be ruled out as causes by your doctor. In addition, a chronic cough may be a side effect of medication, including a class of blood pressure and heart medications known as ACE inhibitors. If you take one of these blood pressure pills and develop a cough, tell your doctor.

            A cough, fever, and chest pains with or without other common cold symptoms are often indicators of pneumonia. Failure to improve after fortyeight hours of treatment for pneumonia is a strong indication of a more serious infection requiring immediate medical evaluation. Note: These symptoms are sometimes indicators of blood clots in the lungs (see Tips 62 to 64, 175, and 249).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                People often think pneumonia always follows a bad cold. That is, first you have the typical cold symptoms—congestion in the head and a sore throat—and then your symptoms spread to the chest, accompanied by coughing. Not so. The first symptoms may be the sudden onset of a cough, fever, and chest pains, with no cold symptoms whatsoever. If this occurs, you should see your doctor right away.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once you start treatment for pneumonia, your condition should improve within forty-eight hours. If it does not, touch base with your doctor again. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop shortness of breath, since this may indicate that the therapy is ineffective at this point and that the infection in your lungs has reached a very serious stage. If you have had your spleen removed, pneumonia can very quickly become fatal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pneumonia is often caused by the bacterium pneumococcus. Alcoholics, smokers, senior citizens, and frail or disabled persons are particularly susceptible to this strain of pneumonia. While the vaccine for pneumococcal pneumonia may prevent the disease or help the body’s defenses fight it, many other germs can also cause pneumonia, including staphylococcus, mycoplasma, and hemophilus.  
            </p>

            <p>
                These symptoms could also be caused by a rare condition called Legionnaires’ disease, which is difficult to culture and identify. The illness often starts with diarrhea and possibly other flu-like symptoms. Then it goes on to involve the lungs. When this occurs you may have severe shortness of breath, fever, and a cough in which you bring up no phlegm (or only a small amount). This condition can be fatal if left untreated. The secret to survival is early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment. The disease is named Legionnaires’ disease because it was first discovered at an American Legion conference. Several members of the American Legion contracted the disease because the germ had contaminated the conference room’s air-conditioning system.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the cough, fever, and chest pain are diagnosed as being due to blood clots in the lung, your doctor will start you on blood thinners and other therapies immediately. This treatment can be life-saving.

            Cough, fever, and night sweats may be signs of tuberculosis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Tuberculosis (TB) infections most commonly occur in the lungs but they can spread to other parts of the body. In the common course of the disease, an early cough is joined by other symptoms like weight loss, night sweats, and an overall ill feeling.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a while, tuberculosis seemed to be a disease of the past. Improved medications and the isolation of infected persons helped decrease the prevalence of this ailment. But stronger forms of the bacterium have caused a marked resurgence of TB. Even powerful drugs are not very effective in killing some of these new TB germs.
            </p>

            <p>
                TB can spread through nursing homes, attacking senior citizens, the debilitated, and AIDS patients, but in rare instances, there have been outbreaks of TB among healthy individuals. These outbreaks are more likely to occur in close quarters where air is recirculated through air-conditioning systems. People who have traveled extensively overseas are generally more likely to contract and spread TB.
            </p>

            <p>
                These red light signals warrant immediate evaluation by a physician. If you have tuberculosis, adhere to your medical regimen, since the disease can be fatal. In addition to tuberculosis, other possible causes of these symptoms include various infections of the lung and cancers such as lymphoma.
