            If you experience episodes of chest pain, tightness, and burning that extend to the neck, throat, jaw,
            and/or left shoulder and upper arm, usually lasting less than twenty minutes, you may be experiencing
            angina. This discomfort often occurs with exertion, but sometimes occurs during rest or sleep. It is often a
            precursor to a heart attack and needs immediate evaluation and treatment.

                Your heart muscle has three small but vital blood vessels on its surface. When one or more of these
                blood vessels becomes partially blocked, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen and nutrition.
                Subsequent changes in the heart muscle irritate its nerve supply, producing pain. Elderly patients, who
                are more likely to experience painless heart attacks than younger patients, are also more likely to
                experience angina without this classic squeezing chest pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Angina differs from a heart attack in that the artery supplying the heart muscle is not totally blocked
                by fat or blood clots, while in a heart attack the blockage is total. If you have a heart attack, the
                lack of oxygen and nutrition persists, the chest pain continues, and part of the heart muscle is
                irreversibly damaged.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pain from angina often appears when you exert yourself, either mildly (shaving or walking up stairs)
                or more strenuously (lifting objects or exercising). It typically disappears with the cessation of
                exertion. However, it should be noted that angina can also occur without exertion, sometimes during rest
                or sleep.
            </p>

                Watch out for these symptomsâ€”if you have angina, you are at a much higher risk of having a heart attack.
                The partially blocked artery that is causing your angina is susceptible to total blockage by a blood
                clot. Anyone having angina attacks should have a thorough heart evaluation, which may include an EKG
                while exercising, a heart scan, and a catheterization to examine the arteries that nourish the heart.
                (Also see Appendix C, for more about heart disease screening.)

                There are many effective medical treatments for angina. It is urgent that you go to the emergency room
                in the following situations, which may be red light warning signals of an impending heart attack:
                <ul>
                    <li>The first time you notice you have angina</li>
                    <li>Angina when you are at rest</li>
                    <li>Angina that wakes you up at night</li>
                    <li>A change in the pattern of your angina pain, such as becoming more severe, more frequent, or
                        longer lasting</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
