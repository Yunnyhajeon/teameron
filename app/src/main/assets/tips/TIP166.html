            Back pain that originates just above the belt line on one side of the lower back, often accompanied by blood-tinged urine, indicates kidney disease that may require immediate medical attention. The pain is sometimes associated with fever and urination problems and is worsened when you gently tap the affected area.

<p>
                This type of back pain is sometimes accompanied by fever and/or pain and difficulty urinating. Also, pain is more likely to occur on the sides of the back and in the abdomen than exclusively in the center of the lower back (see Figure 13).
            </p>

                It is important that you seek medical evaluation and treatment for this type of back pain as soon as possible. It may be caused by a kidney stone, which often requires medical intervention for removal. Also, if there is a kidney infection, antibiotics are required. (See Tip 130 for more information on evaluation and treatment of urinary tract infections. Also, see Appendix C, for information on preventive kidney screenings.)
