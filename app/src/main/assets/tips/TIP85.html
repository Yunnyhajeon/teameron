            A rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. An elevated pulse is a common side effect of hyperthyroidism, dehydration, fever, anxiety, and certain medications. Also, a persistent rise in your pulse may be a sign that you are bleeding internally, often in the stomach or intestines. Any unexplained elevation in your pulse may indicate a need for medical evaluation and treatment.

                Your pulse will normally go up when you run, climb stairs, et cetera, but a resting pulse around 115 or greater is always cause for concern, and depending on the cause, emergency medical treatment can be life-saving. A rise in pulse may be the first signal of a life-threatening hemorrhage in areas such as the stomach or intestines, followed by a drop in blood pressure. When blood loss occurs over a long period of time, a rapid pulse may be accompanied by fatigue and paleness.
