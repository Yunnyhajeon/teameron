            A lump anywhere in the neck can be a sign of a serious illness.

                The most serious neck lumps are often not associated with thyroid disease (in the front base of the
                neck). These lumps are only found on one side of your neck and are usually indicative of a lymph node
                that has become enlarged due to an infection. If the lump is located toward the front of your neck, it
                is probably the result of a throat infection. If it is in the back, it is probably the result of a scalp
                or ear infection. These enlarged lymph nodes are often less than an inch thick, and have a rubbery,
                semi-soft feel. They should shrink within fourteen days of treatment of the infection.

                Lumps in the neck that are present for longer than fourteen days, are over one inch in size, are firm or
                hard in texture, and/or are not tender are more suspicious and may signify cancer of the lymph nodes or
                cancer that has spread from another site.

                These are the general guidelines for examining lymph nodes, but there are exceptions. Seek advice from
                your doctor if any such lump persists.
