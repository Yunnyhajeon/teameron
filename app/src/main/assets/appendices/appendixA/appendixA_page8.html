                <b>Overview</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Any infant, child, or adult whose breathing or heartbeat stops will rapidly experience damage to his or her vital organs, especially the brain. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) allows oxygen to reach the vital organs until expert help can be given in a hospital. This is a critical skill for you to learn. In this section, we provide you with general CPR guidelines. Of course, attending a CPR training course is the best way to learn; a written summary can give you only an outline.

                However, even if you have not had CPR training, do not let this prevent you
