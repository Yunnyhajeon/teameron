            Though it is rare, a child can develop acute kidney failure with a low blood count (anemia) following diarrhea or a respiratory infection. Symptoms of kidney failure include reduced urine output, red or brown urine, drowsiness, irritability, paleness, and tiny "needlepoint" red spots on the skin. Immediate medical management (ideally by a pediatric kidney specialist or nephrologist) is necessary to save the child's life in a case of acute kidney failure.

                Sometimes after bloody diarrhea (particularly when caused by the bacteria E. coli), or more rarely after a respiratory infection, a child may suddenly develop temporary kidney failure and severe anemia. This is called hemolytic uremic syndrome and is more common in children under the age of three. Emergency medical therapy improves the chance for survival and lowers the risk of long-term kidney problems.
