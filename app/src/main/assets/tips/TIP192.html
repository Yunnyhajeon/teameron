            If you are in the first four months of pregnancy and you have noted the reappearance of vaginal bleeding and/or cramping, it is important to check with your doctor immediately

<p>
            This bleeding and/or cramping could be the first sign of an inevitable miscarriage, or a pregnancy that is failing. In this case, the embryo is likely to pass from the uterus (womb) through the vagina. You may have severe bleeding during a miscarriage, and surgery may be required in order to stop this bleeding.
            </p>
<p>
            Another life-threatening cause could be an ectopic pregnancy. In this condition the pregnancy is in your fallopian tube. A pregnancy test will come back positive. An egg fertilized in the fallopian tube normally moves to the uterus and implants in the uterine wall, where it continues to grow. But if the embryo does not make it to the uterus, it will continue to grow in the fallopian tube, and the tube may rupture. This can lead to a severe life-threatening hemorrhage into the belly. You will not see the bleeding, although you may experience symptoms such as belly pain, weakness, a rapid pulse, dizziness, and a dark bloody vaginal discharge. (Also see Tip 7 for more information about emergency internal bleeding.) Sometimes you can feel when the tube ruptures; the sharp pain you may have been experiencing suddenly diminishes.
            </p>
<p>
            Both of these conditions require immediate evaluation by a doctor. Vaginal bleeding and/or cramping in these circumstances are the warning signs of a potentially life-threatening condition.

            Alternatively, the symptoms may result from other causes, including certain hormonal imbalances.
