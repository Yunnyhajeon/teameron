            Any woman who notices persistent and/or unexplained bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, and/or feeling full more quickly should be evaluated by a physician. While these symptoms have many common causes that are not serious, they could also be the first symptoms of life-threatening conditions such as ovarian or other types of cancer. Identifying the source early can improve the odds of successful treatment.
