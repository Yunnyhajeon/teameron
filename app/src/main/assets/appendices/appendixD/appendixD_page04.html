                    <li>Lay the child on his/her stomach.</li>
                    <li>Spread the buttocks with one hand and lay the same arm on the child’s back to limit struggling.</li>
                    <li>Insert the thermometer gently and slowly about an inch into the rectum. NEVER force the thermometer; it should slide in easily.</li>
                    <li>Hold the buttocks together to help keep the thermometer in place. Do not leave the child unattended while waiting for a temperature reading.</li>
                    <li>If using a digital thermometer, wait until the display indicates the child’s temperature.</li>
                    <li>If using a glass thermometer, wait three minutes before reading the temperature. Slowly turn the thermometer until you see the line of mercury. Each long line represents one full degree and each short line represents 0.2 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Wash the thermometer with warm water and soap after each use and store in a safe place.</li>
