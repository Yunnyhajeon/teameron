            A low count of red blood cells (anemia) can cause paleness, fatigue, and a rapid pulse with or without shortness of breath. In certain cases you may feel dizzy or pass out. Diagnosing and treating causes of a low blood count can be life-saving.

<p>
                There are many reasons why you could have a low blood count, including:
                <ul>
<li>Poor nutrition</li>
<li>A disease that destroys the bone marrow, where red blood cells are made</li>
<li>A drug that causes red blood cells to break apart</li>
<li>Cancer in the colon with a slow bleed</li>
<li>Heavy menstrual flow</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                It is important to seek medical attention to diagnose the cause of your low blood count because, in many cases, early treatment can cure the underlying ailment. This is also important because—apart from the possibility of a serious underlying condition—a very low blood count can do significant damage to your organs all on its own. Red blood cells have the vital role of supplying oxygen to your brain and heart. For that reason, when your blood count is dangerously low, an immediate emergency blood transfusion may be needed to save your life.
            </p>
<p>
                The doctor can easily tell how low your blood count is by drawing a sample of your blood and performing a simple test. (See Appendix C, page 384, about blood test screenings.) If you have symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and/or pale skin, you should see a doctor right away to determine your blood count and get a thorough evaluation. If you also have a rapid pulse, the bleeding may be sudden, requiring immediate transport to an emergency room.
