            An irregular, usually rapid pulse may appear with the following symptoms: a feeling like “squirrels running around in your chest,” heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. If your pulse suddenly becomes irregular (and usually rapid), you may be experiencing a serious heart rhythm abnormality known as atrial fibrillation.

                If you have this condition, abnormal electrical impulses are originating from the upper chambers of your heart (the atrium), and are conducted to the lower chambers of your heart (the ventricles), typically in an irregular and rapid fashion. Your pulse is often very irregular and rapid, and can be very difficult to count. When the heart’s electrical system is in this abnormal state, the upper heart chambers are no longer effectively squeezing blood into the lower chambers, and this may result in blood pooling, which can sometimes lead to A blood clot. When this occurs, pieces of the clot can break off and travel through blood vessels to the brain, where they may lodge in a vessel and block blood flow to a part of the brain. This part of the brain will be damaged, causing a stroke.

                Atrial fibrillation frequently occurs in people with heart and lung disease, and in those with hypertension, but it can also occur in people who consume large amounts of alcoholic beverages or in people with an overactive thyroid (which is associated with shaking, tremors, exhaustion, and intolerance to heat). Please note, however, that atrial fibrillation sometimes occurs spontaneously in healthy people.

                Treatment of this disorder may include taking a blood thinner to prevent the blood from clotting. The doctor can convert your heartbeat to a regular rhythm with medication or an electrical shock applied to your heart. If you feel the onset of an irregular and usually rapid pulse with the above symptoms, seek immediate medical care.
