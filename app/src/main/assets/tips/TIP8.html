            There are unusual presentations of a heart attack, such as a painless heart attack. Awareness can save your
            life. You may experience any or a combination of the following: a very weak feeling, sudden dizziness, a
            feeling that your heart is pounding, shortness of breath, and/or a heavy sweat. You may have a feeling of
            impending doom. Nausea and vomiting often accompany these symptoms.

                A heart attack can occur without chest pain, pressure in the chest, or a feeling of indigestion (see Tip
                92). A painless heart attack can be just as deadly, but much more difficult to diagnose.

                If you experience the above symptoms, you may be having a heart attack, especially if you have other
                cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, a
                smoking habit, or a family history of early death from a heart attack. Heart attacks without chest
                discomfort are more often seen among diabetics, women, and senior citizens.

                Whether or not you exhibit the classical symptoms of a heart attack, a doctor can usually make the
                correct diagnosis with an EKG and “dye” (intravenous contrast) studies, examining the small blood
                vessels that nourish your heart. Blood tests for chemical changes in the heart muscle, special types of
                X-rays, and scans of the heart are also helpful. Early diagnosis of a heart attack is crucial since it’s
                possible that lifethreatening complications can be treated. In certain instances immediate therapy can
                prevent permanent heart damage.
