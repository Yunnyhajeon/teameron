            It is important to have the right level of potassium in your blood. Both low and high potassium levels can make you feel very weak and cause muscle cramps. In more serious cases, either condition can lead to a fatal heart rhythm problem.

                Potassium is a mineral found in a wide variety of foods, such as bananas, tomatoes, and orange juice. You can usually get enough of the potassium your body needs from the foods you eat.

                Potassium moves in and out of muscle cells, creating the electrical currents that make your muscles move. This is true for all muscles in your body, including those in your arms, legs, and torso. Low potassium levels in your body can cause profound muscle weakness, spasms, and cramps. The heart is the most important muscle that depends upon potassium. When potassium levels become too low or too high, abnormal electrical currents will travel throughout the heart. The sudden discharge of these abnormal currents can cause it to pump irregularly, which may lead to a sustained heart spasm, followed by death.

                You can lose potassium when vomiting or having diarrhea. This loss is normally replaced through ingested foods and beverages, but long periods of vomiting and diarrhea can result in dangerously low potassium levels, which can be checked with a simple blood test. Taking potassium pills or liquids may be necessary to avoid a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm.

                High blood pressure can be associated with low potassium levels. Most water pills (or diuretics) used to treat high blood pressure, swelling, and heart failure can cause you to lose extra potassium in your urine. If you are taking a diuretic for any reason, you should have your blood potassium level checked by your doctor on a regular basis. Depending on your potassium level, it may be important for you to take supplemental potassium pills or liquids.

                Another rare cause of profound potassium loss can be an overactive adrenal gland (located on top of each kidney), which causes high blood pressure. This condition requires a special medication or the surgical removal of part of the gland to maintain a normal potassium level.

                On the other hand, very high potassium levels can cause heart-pumping irregularities, associated with certain medications, including the blood pressure pill known as an ACE inhibitor. These high potassium levels can also be caused by kidney disease. You should not take extra potassium pills without having your blood potassium levels monitored by your doctor.
            </p>
<p>
                In conclusion, if you experience muscle weakness and/or cramps, especially after diarrhea; are vomiting, taking water pills, taking potassium supplements, or taking the category of blood pressure pills called ACE inhibitors; or if you have a history of kidney disease, you should tell your doctor so he or she can monitor your potassium level. Note: There are many other possible causes of muscle cramps.
