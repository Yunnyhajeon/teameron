                at age fifty. However, there is an ongoing debate among doctors about the advantages of routine PSA screenings. You can have a normal PSA level and have life-threatening prostate cancer. You can also have an elevated PSA level and not have cancer.

Prostate cancer is much more common in men over sixty years of age. However, when older men get prostate cancer, the cancer will often (but not always) act “old” as well, in that it is slow growing. It is usually less aggressive and less likely to spread and become fatal than in a younger man. Therefore, the younger you are, the more important it is to diagnose it early. (The main reason there are not routine screenings recommended before age fifty is that the cancer is relatively rare in younger men.)

African-American men are at higher risk and should consider starting their annual screenings at age forty. Men who have a father, brother, or son who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at an early age (younger than sixty-five years old) are at a higher risk and should consider starting screening at age forty or forty-five. Being overweight and eating a high-fat diet are also risk factors.

               <p><b>Melanoma Skin Cancer Screening</b></p>
If you have a family history of abnormal moles or melanoma, you should have an annual total body skin exam. Other risk factors include fair skin that easily burns, blond or red hair, and/or lots of moles. People with these characteristics should also get annual skin exams. Any time you notice a mole that is changing, appears different, or is very dark, you should have it examined by a dermatologist as soon as possible, since melanomas can spread quickly. (Also, see Tip 155 for further information on the detection of malignant melanomas.) Patients with melanoma skin cancer can be cured if it is caught early enough. Note: In general, the risk of developing skin cancer increases with exposure to the sun, especially under the age of 18.
