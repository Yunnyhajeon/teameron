            If you experience moderate to severe pain in one eye when you move both eyes, it could be an infection or
            tumor in the orbit of that eye (the eye socket).

                It is important to make a diagnosis immediately. If itâ€™s an infection, it can instantly spread to your
                brain if not treated right away. This can occur in either adults or children, and vision can be lost
                quickly and permanently. Go to an emergency room immediately for evaluation and treatment. Ideally have
                someone drive you there.
