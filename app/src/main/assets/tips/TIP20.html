            If a haze, blur, cloud, or darkness appears over  the field of vision in one of your eyes—even if it lasts for only a few seconds—it can be a sign that you are about to have a stroke. This symptom is often described as “a curtain being pulled down over one eye.”

<p>
                If you experience a blur, haze, mist, fog, or darkness over the field of vision in one of your eyes—usually lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes—it could indicate a partial blockage in one of the blood vessels leading from your heart into your neck or some of those supplying your brain. When this happens, it means that the blood vessel supplying the nerve to your eye or the part of your brain responsible for vision is not getting enough blood. Emergency treatment to prevent a stroke is necessary; a blood thinner may be given and/or surgery may be instituted to clean out the blocked artery.

                You need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.  Emergency treatment may prevent a stroke.
