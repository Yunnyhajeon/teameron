            Dark spots (brown in African Americans and Asians, pink to dusty red in Caucasians) on the palms of the hands and/or soles of the feet may be a sign of syphilis or Rocky Mountain spotted fever. If treated early, fatal complications can be avoided.

                While the telltale dark spots of Rocky Mountain spotted fever are usually accompanied by a high fever and severe headache (see Tip 162 for additional information on Rocky Mountain spotted fever), dark spots may be the only sign that the syphilis germ is living in your body. Also, since Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by a germ transmitted by a tick bite, finding a tick on your body is an immediate tip-off that you may have contracted the disease. Syphilis, on the other hand, is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It is important to diagnose and treat early because the damage it may do to the body organs cannot be reversed. It is particularly dangerous in pregnant women, as it can be passed to the fetus and cause life-threatening complications for the baby.

                Urgent treatment of either ailment may be life-saving.
