                            <li>All older adults should be screened regularly for thyroid function, vitamin B12 deficiencies, vitamin D deficiencies, anemia, obesity, unintentional weight loss, alcoholism, vision and hearing deficits, osteoporosis, incontinence, and pain.</li>
                            <li>Some doctors suggest that older adults be screened for dementia (including Alzheimer’s) and depression.</li>
                            <li>Screening for increased risk of falls can be valuable for the elderly population. This involves taking the patient’s history in addition to observing him or her while he/she performs simple actions like sitting down, rising from a seated position, and walking.</li>
                            <li>At each medical checkup, older adults should make sure that the doctor reviews all the drugs being prescribed by their treating physicians. They should bring all their pill bottles with them to all their doctors’ visits.</li>
                            <li>Every older adult should get an annual influenza vaccination, as well as the pneumococcal vaccine every five years, and a tetanus booster every ten years. The CDC has also recommended that seniors get immunized for Herpes Zoster.</li>
                            <li>Routine visits to the dentist continue to be important with increasing age.</li>
                            <li>Some doctors recommend that all men who have ever smoked should be scanned once between the ages of sixty-five and seventy-five for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</li>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                You may want to ask your doctor about the following optional screenings, with the knowledge that certain tests are not without risks themselves. Obviously, you must also factor in the cost of any test.
            </p>

            <p><b>Aneurysm  Screening</b></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An ultrasound of the aorta (a picture taken with sound waves of the aorta in the abdomen) screens for aneurysms. Aneurysms are more commonly found in those who have high blood pressure, have smoked cigarettes for five years (or longer), or have family members who have had aneurysms.</li>
                </ul>
