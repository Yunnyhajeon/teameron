            It’s always important to know why you have had blood clots (phlebitis). The cause may require long-term therapy. Also, it may be related to an undiagnosed disorder that needs to be diagnosed and treated. Ask your doctor if he/she can deter- mine the cause of your blood clots.

                Phlebitis, or what doctors refer to as deep venous thrombosis, is when you have blood clots in the veins, most often in the legs. It is a true medical emergency and warrants immediate medical attention. However, when you get out of the hospital and all of the anxiety has subsided, you need to find out why you had phlebitis, so that repeat episodes can be prevented. Also, it needs to be determined if there is an urgent underlying problem that has to be addressed. Do not put it off.

                The process of blood clotting is a complex series of chemical reactions. There are a number of things that can go wrong, increasing the risk of dangerous blood clots. For example, it is possible for substances called abnormal antibodies to pro- mote excessive clotting of the blood. Though antibodies are made by the body’s immune system, these antibodies can do harm by causing the blood to clot inappropriately. Their presence can be determined by blood tests. If you have them, you are under a continual risk of another blood clot, and there is a need for prolonged anticoagulation (blood-thinning) therapy to prevent recurrence of the blood clots. You may also need long-term treatment if the reason you got the blood clot is heart failure or if your work involves long periods of sitting still, since either circumstance puts you at a much higher risk of developing future blood clots.

                More serious conditions can also lead to increased blood clotting. One of the possibilities is cancer—many types of cancer cause few or no symptoms and sometimes the only tip- off to their presence is an episode of phlebitis.

                Don’t let this happen to you. Ask your doctor why you had blood clots. (Also see Tip 139 for a full description of the symptoms of phlebitis and Tip 249 about preventive measures for anyone with phlebitis who is hospitalized for any reason. Also see Tips 62 to 64 and 81 for symptoms relating to blood clots in the lungs or leg.)
