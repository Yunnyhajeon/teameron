            Swelling, pain, and tenderness in the groin or leg may indicate the presence of blood clots, which can travel to the lungs.

                Irritation of the walls of the veins is a prime setup for blood clots, because the blood can back up in these vessels. One sign that blood clots may be forming is if the back of the lower leg often hurts and is tender to the touch. This condition is known as phlebitis, meaning “inflammation of veins.”
            </p>
            <p>
                There are many causes of phlebitis, including:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The pooling of blood in the legs along with certain dilated and damaged veins near the surface of the skin (varicose veins)</li>
                    <li>An injury to one of the legs</li>
                    <li>Sitting for long periods of time (often during a trip in a car or airplane)</li>
                    <li>Lying in bed for an extended period of time (being bedridden at home or in the hospital)</li>
                    <li>Cancer of the lung, colon, or blood, which may produce chemicals that attack the veins of the legs and cause phlebitis (this is sometimes the first indication that a cancer exists)</li>
                    <li>A generalized inflammation of blood vessels that develops with diseases of the connective tissue, such as lupus</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                Phlebitis is potentially deadly because a large piece of the blood clot in a vein of the leg might break off and travel through the blood vessels from the leg to the lungs. A clot in the lungs produces shortness of breath and an inability to oxygenate the blood, which can be life-threatening. (See Tips 62 to 64, 81, 175, and 249.) It is therefore urgent that you see a doctor for evaluation and treatment, including a blood thinner if appropriate.

            Pain in your legs, hips, and/or buttocks when you walk could be from arthritis but could also be from clogged arteries. When occuring in the leg, it is usually only in one. When the blockage of the arteries is total, gangrene of the leg and infection can occur. This infection may then spread to the rest of your body.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Pain in the legs during activities such as walking that is relieved during rest is usually due to insufficient blood flow to the legs. During activity the leg muscles require more blood, and when they do not receive it, you feel pain. The distance you can walk before the pain occurs is determined by the degree of blockage in the artery to your leg. A severe blockage may bring on the pain after walking only a few feet, and a less severe blockage may allow you to walk without pain for as much as a quarter of a mile. In very rare cases, the pain occurs at the first attempt to walk but then disappears after you have been walking for a while. If the blockage is in the arteries of the thighs, then the pain will be in the calves. A higher blockage will cause pain in the hips, buttocks, and thighs—this type of blockage is more commonly seen in patients who smoke, or have diabetes or high cholesterol.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a blood clot forms in the markedly narrowed area of the artery, then a complete blockage of the artery will follow, with severe leg pain. If the blood flow is interrupted for too long, causing gangrene, there is risk that a life-threatening infection will spread throughout the body. In this scenario, amputation of the leg may be necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience pain in your leg when you walk, you should seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. It is best to correct the problem before total blockage occurs. Circulation may be restored by cleaning out the blockage: The artery can be reopened at the narrowed area with a small tube tipped with an inflatable balloon. Surgical repair is also possible: One end of a small piece of blood vessel can be sewn to the blocked vessel above the site of the obstruction, while the other end is sewn below the site of the blockage. This will allow blood to bypass or detour the site of the obstruction. A third approach is to inject a substance into the blood vessel that can dissolve the blood clot.

            A deep, aching pain that starts in the lower back or buttocks and travels down the back of the leg can be due to the irritation of one of the nerves in the spine. If left untreated for many weeks or months, the compression of the nerve root can lead to nerve damage, causing permanent weakness, numbness, or even regional paralysis.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">

                The soft disks between the cords of the vertebral bones in the back provide cushions for the spine. As we age, these disks can become brittle, a condition known as degenerative disks. When they bulge or tear, the disks may press upon large nerves as they leave the spinal canal, causing symptoms in the parts of the body where the strained nerve usually travels. If this happens in the neck area, symptoms of weakness or numbness may travel into the arms. If it happens in the lower back, pain may travel into the buttocks and down the back of the leg, making it difficult to lift up the toes. This can cause the foot to slap the floor while walking.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the great majority of cases of degenerative disks and disk herniations, the symptoms will resolve on their own in six to eight weeks. When this does not occur, your doctor may need to see you in order to prevent permanent damage. Even when the pain resolves, it is important to continue to maintain good back care. This may include plans for long-term weight loss, core body exercises like yoga and pilates, as well as swimming and water aerobics. Also, be sure to use back healthy techniques when lifting heavy objects (e.g., lifting from a squatting position “with the legs” instead of bending forward).

                Note: While a stroke can also cause weakness or numbness of a limb, unlike nerve root compression, strokes are usually pain free.

            Unexplained and persistent bone pain, particularly if it wakes you in the middle of the night, warrants evaluation by a doctor. It may be cancer originating in the bone or another cancer that has spread to the bones.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                You need to be able to distinguish this deep, aching kind of bone pain from pains in the joints, which are usually due to overexertion or arthritis. In the early stages of bone cancer, the pain may be intermittent, but it will often get worse at night. As the cancer develops, the pain will become more severe and constant, and may also worsen with movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cancer originating in the bone can involve the bone itself or the core of the bone where blood cells are made. It is best to have these serious problems ruled out when you have severe bone pain before seeking therapies such as spinal adjustments, manipulations, acupuncture, etc. Early treatment of cancer can make a difference in your outcome.
