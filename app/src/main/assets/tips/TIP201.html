            If your child has a fever and starts convulsing (having seizures), it is important for you to know how to react. The convulsions may affect only one side of the body and/or the child may possibly turn blue. Regardless of how long the convulsions last, you should follow the safety steps described below and call an ambulance. The child will need to be evaluated by a physician.

                Children between the ages of six months and six years with a high fever are at risk of convulsing. This condition is known as a febrile seizure. It is more common in children with a family history of febrile seizures. This type of seizure will usually occur early in an illness, during the first spike of fever. It might even be the first sign that the child has a fever. If the temperature rises quickly, febrile seizures are more likely to occur. They can last anywhere from a few seconds to over fifteen minutes.

                It is upsetting to see your child convulsing. Try to be calm and do the following:

                <ul>
<li>Lay your child on his/her side with his/her face tilted toward the floor to prevent him/her from choking on any food or fluids in the mouth. Do not try to restrain him or her.
                    </li>
<li>Do not try to insert your fingers or a spoon into the mouth. It will do more harm than good: You may block his/her airway or lose a finger! A bulb syringe can be used to clear the nose.
                    </li>
<li>FeverAll is a fever-reducing medicine like Tylenol, which is inserted in the rectum instead of given orally. It is equally as effective as Tylenol, and can be used in a child who is convulsing.
                    </li>
<li>Call an ambulance (911 in most locations). If it is the first episode and the child is under eighteen months, medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible causes such as meningitis. In all cases, you should notify your child’s doctor about the seizure.
                    </li>
<li>Remove the child’s outer clothes immediately after the seizure if they are bundled up in a lot of clothing. If the child gets too warm, the temperature may rise again. On the other hand, avoid letting the child get chilled, since this can also make the temperature go back up. Many doctors warn against giving the child a bath, as this may cause the child to get chilled. Other doctors say that it’s okay, as long as the bath is short and the water is not too hot or cold (i.e., lukewarm), especially if the fever is 104˚F (40˚C) or higher. If the child shivers, cover him/ her with a light blanket or light layer of clothing.
                    </li>
<li>
                        Do not give the child anything to eat or drink immediately after the seizure until he or she is able to respond to you. Then, if you haven’t given the child FeverAll during the seizure, give him/her a fever-reducing medicine other than aspirin (ibuprofen or an acetaminophen, such as Tylenol). Never give a child aspirin unless it has been specifically recommended by the child’s pediatrician.
                    </li>
</ul>

                If your child has had a febrile convulsion, he or she has about a 30 percent chance of having another seizure associated with the onset of a fever. Speak to your child’s doctor about special precautions to prevent future febrile seizures. These include the use of medicines to keep the temperature down or to stop the seizures. The risk continues to decrease over time. Less than 2 percent of children with simple febrile seizures will go on to develop epilepsy. For a child with a simple febrile convulsion, there is no association with learning difficulties later in life. All febrile seizures warrant medical evaluation.
