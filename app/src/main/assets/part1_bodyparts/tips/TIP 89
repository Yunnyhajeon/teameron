            If you get an irregular pulse after youâ€™ve experienced excessive fluid loss from diarrhea, water pills, and/or sweating, that irregular pulse may be the result of changes in the mineral levels of your blood, such as the level of potassium. This may have serious health consequences. The red light warning signals may include: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, heart pounding, and muscle cramps in the leg.
