            If you are taking steroid medications (including cortisone, prednisone, hydrocortisone,
            or meth- ylprednisolone) and you get sick with any illness, you must be on the alert.
            These steroid medica- tions may make it difficult for you to recover from the new illness.
            Symptoms indicating that ste- roids are complicating another illness include (but are not
            limited to) fatigue, dizziness, muscle cramps or weakness, and/or salt craving, which may
            require emergency care. These symptoms can also occur if you suddenly stop taking the steroids
            after taking them every day, or if you develop a disease in the adrenal glands.

                The glands on top of your kidneys, the adrenal glands, are small but very important
                in helping your body to function normally. They produce steroids and other essential
                hormones, and maintain the balance of salt and water in your body. Steroid-type medications
                can decrease the production of natural steroids by the adrenal glands, because the steroid
                medication usually substitutes for your natural steroid hormones.
            </p>

            <p>
               When you get sick, however, and your body needs more of these hormones, these glands
                are often so suppressed that your body develops symptoms from a lack of steroids.
                This can also happen if you have been taking steroids for a while and you suddenly
                stop taking them; the natural hormones may not be immediately available, causing you
                to become very ill. Muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, vomiting, and
                dehydration can develop very rapidly. In some cases, your blood pressure can drop to
                such low levels that death may result.

                Though rare, disease can occur in the adrenal glands, which will directly affect their
                functioning. Also, since the pituitary gland, which is located under the brain,
                produces hormones that control the adrenal glands, any malfunction in the pituitary
                glands may also lead to the improper functioning of the adrenal glands. This will
                cause you to have the symptoms of dehydration. Emergency medical treatment can save
                your life when you do not have enough steroids in your body.
