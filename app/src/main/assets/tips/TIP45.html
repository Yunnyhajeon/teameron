            A lump in the armpit may be an enlarged lymph node, indicating a serious illness.

                Lumps in the armpit are common. Most are tender sweat glands that have become clogged with
                deodorants—particularly those containing “drying agents.” If these glands get infected, they may form
                large pus pockets that require drainage. Usually lumps caused by clogged sweat glands can be
                distinguished from other lumps because you cannot move them separately from the skin with your fingers.
                When you can move the lump separately, it usually indicates that it is deep beneath the skin and is a
                lymph node.

                Enlarged lymph nodes in the armpit are often due to infections in the arm or hand. The most serious
                potential cause of an enlarged lymph node is cancer that has spread to that node. Early medical
                evaluation of the cause of a lump in the armpit is important, especially since it could be a red light
                warning signal of a treatable cancer, like breast cancer.
