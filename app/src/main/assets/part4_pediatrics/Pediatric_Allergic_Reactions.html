            In susceptible individuals, a severe allergic reaction affecting the entire body, called anaphylactic shock, may follow an insect sting or the ingestion of certain medications or foods. The red light warning signals include sudden swelling of the eyes, lips, and tongue; difficulty breathing; and weakness, a feeling of faintness, or fainting. Immediate emergency care is required to prevent death.

            <p>
                Individuals who are more prone to allergies or who have a family member who has had a life-threatening reaction to an allergen are more likely to go into anaphylactic shock when they come into contact with certain substances.

            </p>

            <p>
                The most common causes are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Insect bites</li>
                    <li>Medications, especially in the penicillin family</li>
                    <li>Foods such as peanuts, shellfish, and strawberries</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                The individual may have a flushed or pale appearance. They may first experience a burning of the lips followed within minutes by a puffy face and neck, as well as breathing difficulties. They may complain of itching or belly pain, begin to vomit, and/or develop a blotchy, raised red rash or hives. Call an ambulance immediately (911 in most locations).


            </p>

            <p>
                If you or your child has had a reaction like this one before, always carry an epinephrine injection kit (i.e., an EpiPen) with you, and know how to use it. If your child is old enough, teach him or her how to self-administer the injection. Get him or her an identity bracelet, clearly showing the medical details of his/her allergies and the necessary treatment. An allergist should also be consulted, as he or she may be able to reduce the severity of your childâ€™s reactions with appropriate treatment, often including a series of shots. (See Tip 169 for more information on allergies.)
