            The best method to control blood spurting from a blood vessel due to a severe laceration is to put direct pressure on the wound and pressure on another blood vessel between the wound and the heart. Some examples of good secondary pressure points are between the shoulder and elbow, the groin area, and behind the knee. This approach is better than using a tourniquet. Also, elevate the wound area above the heart if possible.
