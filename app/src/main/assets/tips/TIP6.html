            It is possible for dizziness to suddenly become so severe as to render you nonfunctional and cause you to
            fall or—if you are driving—crash your vehicle. Nausea and vomiting may also occur.

                Dizziness may take the form of light-headedness (see Tip 7), or it may make you feel like you are
                spinning on a carousel (vertigo). The balance system consists of multiple factors: To feel balanced,
                your inner-ear apparatus and cerebellum (the small area of the brain in the back of the skull
                responsible for coordination) need to be normally functioning (see Figure 1). A breakdown in any of
                these systems can make you feel dizzy, particularly when you change your body position. Inner-ear
                disease can be sporadic, with a sudden and quite severe onset.

                It may cause vertigo, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A strained neck may also sometimes cause
                vertigo.

                If you are experiencing vertigo, you are at a higher risk for falls. Falls can lead to serious injuries,
                such as hip fractures, and if the attack occurs when you are driving, you could have a serious auto
                accident. Do not drive, and avoid climbing stairs alone until your problem has been stabilized by
                medical treatment. If you experience vertigo (with or without nausea and vomiting), you need medical
                evaluation as soon as possible.
