        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING COMES DIRECTLY AFTER THE SECTION TITLE
        Example: HEAD section title is directly followed by HEADACHE subsection in the book, aka 
                 headache is the first subsection of the section

        ONLY UNCOMMENT THIS IF THIS SUBHEADING IS THE FIRST SUBSECTION OF THE SECTION

                Compress the chest 30 times, HARD and FAST at a rate of 100 beats/ minute, following the guidelines below for adults, children, and infants:
            </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Adults (>8 yrs old or >55 lbs): Place the heel of one hand on top of the other with your fingers pointing along the direction of the ribs. Use two hands to push firmly two inches deep on the center of the chest (the sternum) at the nipple line. Allow the chest to recoil between each compression.</li>
                            <li>Children (1–8 yrs of age): Positioning is the same as an adult, but depending on your size and the size of the child, you may not need the extra force of the second hand over the first. With one or two hands, push on the center of the chest at the nipple line 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch deep. Allow the chest to recoil between  each compression.</li>
                            <li>Infants (<1 year of age): Since an infant is much smaller than an adult, your actions will be adjusted accordingly. Place the tips of your two fingers in the middle of the breastbone, one finger-width below the nipple line. With two fingers, push on the chest 1⁄3 to 1⁄2 inch deep. Allow the chest to recoil between each compression.</li>
                        </ul>
            <p>
                
If the victim does not begin to breathe on their own after 30 compressions, then continue to repeat the CPR cycle, alternating between 30 compressions and 2 breaths.

*Do not be surprised if you feel popping or cracking under your hands when you are providing good, hard, and fast compressions to someone’s chest. This is normal and they will heal from this in the hospital. Continue providing the good, hard, and fast compressions; they are crucial to keep moving the blood and oxygen around the body to keep the victim’s vital organs oxygenated.
</p>
<p>
*Some experts in CPR training suggest that the rate of compressions is approximately the beat of the Bee Gees song “Stayin’ Alive.” Humming this melody to yourself may help make it easier to do compressions at the proper rate.
