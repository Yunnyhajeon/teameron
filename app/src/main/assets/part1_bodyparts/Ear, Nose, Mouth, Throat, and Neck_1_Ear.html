            Unexplained gradual or sudden hearing loss in one ear, with a sense that the room is spinning around, and/or ringing in the ear may be an indication of a tumor of the nerve responsible for hearing or another problem near this nerve.

                Hearing loss due to aging is a common, gradual process, which is often hardly noticed until someone else points it out. Another common source of hearing loss—noise exposure— is also gradual and occurs in both ears. Other people experience hearing loss because of their genetic inheritance.

                But what about the loss of hearing in one ear that is accompanied by a feeling that the room is spinning around, and/or a ringing in the ear? A rare but serious illness that can cause these symptoms is a tumor of the hearing nerve (or near this nerve). Urgent medical evaluation is needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another more common cause of hearing loss and this type of dizziness is an inflammation of the hearing apparatus in the ear. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent permanent damage. Another cause of these symptoms may be Ménière’s disease. Even though the cause of these symptoms is sometimes not found, there may still be effective treatments, so it is important to see a doctor for a thorough evaluation.

            Hearing the sound of your heartbeat inside your head, usually in association with episodic headaches, could mean that you have a blood vessel malformation capable of causing a stroke.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                It is common to hear your heartbeat in your ear when you lie down and place your ear against a pillow. But if you notice the onset of pulsating noise similar to a beating heart on one side of your head, and if it is constantly present no matter how your body is positioned, it is abnormal. It could indicate a problem with your ear or a blood vessel abnormality inside your head or neck (particularly if it is in association with episodic throbbing headaches on one side of your head).
            </p>

            <p>
                The rare type of blood vessel abnormality most likely to produce this heartbeat sound is called a dural arteriovenous malformation. Under normal circumstances, veins carry blood to the heart, while arteries carry blood away from it. This abnormality, often present at birth, is caused by the direct connection of an artery to a vein, which significantly increases blood pressure in the veins. As time passes, these malformations may get larger and begin producing the heartbeat sound with such intensity that it can be heard in the ear closest to the malformation.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience these symptoms, seek medical evaluation by a neurologist or a neurosurgeon. A blood vessel malformation may need to be repaired so it will not rupture and cause a brain hemorrhage. A tumor is another possible cause of these symptoms. A rare cause is a partial blockage of an artery in the neck. A more common cause is rapid or turbulent blood flow in the veins around the ear.
