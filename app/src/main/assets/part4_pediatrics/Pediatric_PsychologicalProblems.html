            If you suspect that your child or adolescent is depressed, immediately seek appropriate help. Suicide is one of the most common causes of death among teenagers.

                Depression can happen in even the most loving of homes.  Whether or not it is precipitated by a personal crisis, it is usually caused by a chemical imbalance and/or a family predisposition. Children and teenagers with depression are often labeled “difficult” or “moody” rather than given appropriate help. The stigma of depression can also cause people to avoid seeking help—a delay that can have tragic results.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clinical depression is a prolonged, persistent disturbance of mood, often with associated physical symptoms. The warning signs may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Persistent sadness and complaints, with a negative self image</li>
                    <li>Lack of interest in favorite activities and food</li>
                    <li>Withdrawal from family and friends (at times with hostility)</li>
                    <li>Worsening school performance</li>
                    <li>Anxiety about simple tasks and events</li>
                    <li>Sleep disturbances, either insomnia or hypersomnia (long periods of sleep)</li>
                    <li>Appetite changes: loss of appetite or overeating</li>
                    <li>Multiple physical complaints: aches and pains everywhere</li>
                    <li>Hinting at suicide or giving away prized possessions</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Apparent personality change in a teenager/extreme teenage rebelliousness</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a greater risk that your depressed child might commit suicide if the following risk factors apply to him/her:
                <ul>
                    <li>Male sex (although more girls attempt suicide, more boys actually succeed)</li>
                    <li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
                    <li>A gun in the house (firearms are used the most to commit suicide in America)</li>
                    <li>A previous suicide attempt</li>
                    <li>A recent suicide in your area</li>
                    <li>A bereavement experience: a death, a divorce, a failed exam, rejection by friends, and the like</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If your child exhibits symptoms of depression and/or is at risk of committing suicide, get them assessed and treated before they can injure themselves seriously. With counseling and medication (if appropriate), he or she can go on to live a full and normal life. (See Tip 12 for more on depression).

            Anorexia and bulimia are dangerous life-threatening conditions that require expert treatment as soon as possible. Overeating and obesity can also be serious health hazards.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Anorexia is common in preadolescent and adolescent girls and is sometimes even seen in boys. The affected individual has an overpowering fear of being fat, accompanied by behavior intended to result in weight loss, such as not eating, excessive exercise, etc. Bulimia tends to occur in older adolescents or adults and is associated with binge eating and purging (self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives). Bulimia can be more difficult to recognize in an individual, since body weight and shape may appear normal. However, frequent vomiting can cause wear of the enamel on the back teeth, which may be picked up during a routine dental checkup.
            </p>

            <p>
                An affected teenager may:
                <ul>
                    <li>Be preoccupied with their weight and body size</li>
                    <li>Avoid eating with the family and eat very little</li>
                    <li>Use laxatives and diuretics, and induce vomiting</li>
                    <li>Exercise excessively</li>
                    <li>Wear shapeless clothes</li>
                    <li>Have irregular menstrual periods or a persistent absence of periods</li>
                    <li>Develop fine, downy hairs on the face and trunk</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                There are many medical complications associated with anorexia and bulimia, which may include kidney and heart complications, damage to the esophagus and/or stomach, and aspiration pneumonia. Self-induced vomiting and purging with laxatives can also cause dangerous imbalances of electrolytes (minerals) in the blood. There is a 10 percent mortality rate among those who have anorexia.
            </p>

            <p>
                The earlier a diagnosis is made and professional help is obtained, the better chance that your daughter or son will have a normal adult life. Lead her/him by your positive example and good eating habits!
