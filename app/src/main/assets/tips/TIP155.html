            Irregular-shaped, dark, multicolored, enlarging, bleeding, itching, or painful moles need to be frequently checked for early detection of malignant melanoma. Early treatment can be life-saving. Being seen within days or a couple of weeks is much better than within months. The sooner, the better.

                Moles that can turn into cancer (malignant melanoma) may be raised, like regular moles, or flush with the skin surface, like large, dark freckles. They often begin as an abnormal growth of pigment cells, which then darken with exposure to the sun. Pigmented lesions on the pads of the hands and soles of the feet (more commonly seen in African Americans), and dark streaks under the fingernails or toenails can also be signs of melanoma. There is even a rare type of melanoma that has no pigment.

                If you have a mole or moles with any of the following features (which suggest they are cancerous), see your doctor or a dermatologist right away:
                <ul>
<li>Asymmetrical shapeâ€”not a smooth, round circle, like a regular mole</li>
<li>Multicolored appearance with shades of brown, black, gray, red, and white</li>
<li>Large size (greater than the eraser end of a pencil)</li>
<li>Growth in size over a period of time (unlike regular moles, which do not grow)</li>
<li>Itching, pain, or bleeding</li>
<li>Any kind of change in a mole</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                The incidence of malignant melanomas is increasing in the population at large. They are most prevalent in adults over thirty years of age and are actually the most common cancer in people who are between twenty-five and thirty-five. The following increase your risk of developing this cancer:
                <ul>
<li>You have been diagnosed by a physician as having certain types of moles that are precancerous.</li>
<li>Members of your family have had a malignant melanoma.</li>
<li>You are light-skinned and easily sunburned.</li>
<li>You have been exposed to a great deal of sunlight, especially in childhood and adolescence, and have had multiple sunburns in the past.</li>
<li>You have many moles of any kind.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                Monitor your moles on a regular basis, including those in the genital area, where changes are often missed (the use of a mirror may be helpful). Avoid tanning beds. If you are at a high risk of developing a malignant melanoma, your dermatologist or primary care doctor should assist you in monitoring your moles. If you detect a suspicious mole, see your doctor or dermatologist as soon as possible so that it can be removed early and examined under a microscope. A simple removal of the mole is all that is necessary if it is less than .75 millimeters and without special features as seen under the microscope by a pathologist. If there is a need for further surgery, consider getting a thorough evaluation by someone who specializes in melanoma treatment.

                Try to preempt this problem by using sun protection routinely after six months of age. The UVB sun protection factor should be SPF 30 or greater, and the container should indicate that both UVB and UVA light are blocked. (Also see Appendix C, for routine screening information.)
