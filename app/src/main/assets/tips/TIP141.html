            A deep, aching pain that starts in the lower back or buttocks and travels down the back of the leg can be due to the irritation of one of the nerves in the spine. If left untreated for many weeks or months, the compression of the nerve root can lead to nerve damage, causing permanent weakness, numbness, or even regional paralysis.

                The soft disks between the cords of the vertebral bones in the back provide cushions for the spine. As we age, these disks can become brittle, a condition known as degenerative disks. When they bulge or tear, the disks may press upon large nerves as they leave the spinal canal, causing symptoms in the parts of the body where the strained nerve usually travels. If this happens in the neck area, symptoms of weakness or numbness may travel into the arms. If it happens in the lower back, pain may travel into the buttocks and down the back of the leg, making it difficult to lift up the toes. This can cause the foot to slap the floor while walking.

                In the great majority of cases of degenerative disks and disk herniations, the symptoms will resolve on their own in six to eight weeks. When this does not occur, your doctor may need to see you in order to prevent permanent damage. Even when the pain resolves, it is important to continue to maintain good back care. This may include plans for long-term weight loss, core body exercises like yoga and pilates, as well as swimming and water aerobics. Also, be sure to use back healthy techniques when lifting heavy objects (e.g., lifting from a squatting position “with the legs” instead of bending forward).

                Note: While a stroke can also cause weakness or numbness of a limb, unlike nerve root compression, strokes are usually pain free.
