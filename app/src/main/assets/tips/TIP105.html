            Mild lower belly pain or pain during sexual intercourse may be due to an infection of the female organs by a germ called chlamydia or other germs, including the gonorrhea germ. These bacteria can cause significant damage to the fallopian tubes and lead to infertility. They can also cause a life-threatening internal hemorrhage from a tubal pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy).

                The symptoms may be few, but scarring from this type of infection can block the fallopian tube, through which the egg passes, causing infertility. Also, the scarring can interfere with the small fingerlike projections located at the end of the fallopian tubes, which pick up the egg when it bursts from the ovary each month. If it’s not treated early, this may lead to infertility.

                Fertilization normally occurs when an egg travels along the fallopian tube to its midportion and meets with sperm. After fertilization, the egg has approximately three days to travel through the rest of the tube into the cavity of the womb, where it grows on the wall and gets nourishment from the mother’s body. If this trip is delayed by scarring from infections, the fertilized egg will attach in the wall of the tube and begin to grow there. Growth of the embryo can proceed only to a limited size (usually reached at six to eight weeks from the beginning of pregnancy) before the tube ruptures, with the potential of a life-threatening hemorrhage. Lower belly pain, weakness, dizziness, and a rapid pulse may indicate that this rupture has occurred. It requires emergency surgery.

                It is important to know when your female organs are infected in order to prevent damage to your tubes, ovaries, and uterus. Mild discomfort in the lower belly or pain during sexual intercourse may be the only clues that infection is present, though it can usually be detected by testing at the mouth of the womb. Regular checkups with your doctor provide an opportunity for early detection. (See Appendix C, page 377, for more information about sexually transmitted diseases.) If you think you have had sexual contact with someone infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea, or if you have any of these subtle symptoms, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
