            Too much bleeding at the time of your period, an abnormally long period, or bleeding off and on between periods can be the sign of a serious disease.

                Normally your body’s menstrual periods occur every twenty-eight days, give or take seven days, and last approximately four days. If your periods occur less than twenty-one days apart or more than 35 days apart, if they last for more than seven days, or if you experience intermittent bleeding, then you have an abnormal bleeding pattern.

                Abnormal vaginal bleeding can be an indication of cancer of the uterus (womb). Early diagnosis provides an increased opportunity for treating and curing the two types of uterine cancer—cancer of the cervix (mouth of the womb) and cancer of the endometrium (lining of the womb)—both of which can produce abnormal vaginal bleeding. Remember, this abnormal bleeding does not have to be heavy to indicate cancer; even a small amount of bleeding between normal periods or after intercourse can be significant.

                Heavy menstrual bleeding can occur from common, usually noncancerous tumors of the wall of the uterus (fibroid tumors, or leiomyomata). These tumors can compress the blood vessels in the wall of the uterus and distort them, prompting heavy vaginal bleeding. They often need to be removed because they can cause severe pain and they have the potential to become so large that they press on other organs, such as the bladder or rectum. There are also medications that may shrink these tumors.

                An overgrowth of the lining of the womb, though noncancerous, is another cause of excessive and prolonged vaginal bleeding. This condition, usually a result of hormone problems, causes irregular shedding of the lining of the womb and thus abnormal, often heavy, menses. It may be precancerous.

                Women should begin yearly Pap smears when they become sexually active, but no later than when they turn twenty-one years old. Pap smears can detect cancer of the cervix early, even before abnormal bleeding occurs. (See Appendix C, page 376, for details on Pap smear/pelvic screening.) Note: Pap smears do not detect cancer of the endometrium, and the appearance of abnormal vaginal bleeding is usually the only clue that this type of cancer is present.
            </p>

                Birth control pills suppress eggs leaving the ovary and alter the hormone that causes the lining of the uterus to grow. Women who take them may experience sparse periods as a result of a decreased amount of uterine lining growth or increased bleeding due to changes in the hormone level. While scant bleeding is quite normal, heavy bleeding should not continue beyond two months. Report to your doctor any heavy bleeding that soaks more than one pad or tampon every two hours.
            </p>
<p>
                Fortunately most abnormal vaginal bleeding—whether it’s too much or for too long—is not due to cancer. Usually the cause is more easily treatable. However, seek medical evaluation by your doctor as soon as possible, because even certain noncancerous growths can turn into cancer. Also, continued blood loss can result in a dangerously low blood count (anemia), which may require blood transfusion or treatment with iron.
