                 headache is the first subsection of the section

            When your line of vision becomes narrowed or you experience any defect in your field of vision, it may be an important symptom of a pituitary gland tumor, a brain tumor, a stroke, an injury to the retina of the eye, or advanced glaucoma.
        </div>

            <p>
                When you look straight ahead, you can usually see objects on your right and left sides. These are your peripheral fields of vision. The loss of a portion of this peripheral vision will reduce your vision to that of a horse wearing blinders. A person with these symptoms will sometimes find themselves bumping into walls or furniture. This is a red light warning signal.
            </p>

            <p>
                A simple test to detect one type of defect is to put your right hand over your right eye and your left hand behind your left ear. While looking straight ahead, move your left hand slowly so that it is reaching out in front of your face. You should be able to detect this movement out of the corner of your left eye even though you are looking straight ahead. Do the same while looking through your right eye. If either eye fails to pick up your normal peripheral vision, you may have a visual field defect.
            </p>

            <p>
                Possible causes of defects include a stroke due to blockage of a blood vessel in the brain, an injury to the retina of the eye, glaucoma, bleeding in the brain, or a tumor in the area of the brain responsible for vision. A tumor of the pituitary gland, located on the underside of the brain, can also cause these symptoms. If the tumor gets large enough, it can press on the nerves from the eyes, causing the visual field loss. This type of tumor can also produce high levels of hormones, which may cause a milky white discharge from the nipples and may stop or alter menstrual periods. The growth can be controlled medically or surgically.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience a sudden defect in your field of vision, you should go to an emergency room. In all cases, you need evaluation by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) and/or neurologist.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            If a haze, blur, cloud, or darkness appears over  the field of vision in one of your eyes—even if it lasts for only a few seconds—it can be a sign that you are about to have a stroke. This symptom is often described as “a curtain being pulled down over one eye.”
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you experience a blur, haze, mist, fog, or darkness over the field of vision in one of your eyes—usually lasting anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes—it could indicate a partial blockage in one of the blood vessels leading from your heart into your neck or some of those supplying your brain. When this happens, it means that the blood vessel supplying the nerve to your eye or the part of your brain responsible for vision is not getting enough blood. Emergency treatment to prevent a stroke is necessary; a blood thinner may be given and/or surgery may be instituted to clean out the blocked artery.  
            </p>

            <p>
                You need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.  Emergency treatment may prevent a stroke.
