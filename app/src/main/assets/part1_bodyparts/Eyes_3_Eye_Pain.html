            If you experience moderate to severe pain in one eye when you move both eyes, it could be an infection or tumor in the orbit of that eye (the eye socket).

                It is important to make a diagnosis immediately. If it’s an infection, it can instantly spread to your brain if not treated right away. This can occur in either adults or children, and vision can be lost quickly and permanently. Go to an emergency room immediately for evaluation and treatment. Ideally have someone drive you there.

            If you notice that normally straight appearing lines instead look wavy or distorted (for example, when looking at doorways, windows, or furniture), you may have a problem with the retina of your eye that could lead to severe vision loss. Don’t ignore it!
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                You might not notice this problem unless you check each eye separately. Your eyes work together to give you your best vision, so if one eye has a problem, the other eye may compensate for it, hiding this important warning signal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cover one eye and look directly at something with straight edges, like a desk or window. Then switch—cover the other eye and look at the same object. You can also do this by looking at a page of letters in a book. Look for straight lines that appear wavy, distorted, and/or broken. Look for a spot in the center of your vision that is fuzzy or darkened.
            </p>

            <p>
                These may be warning signs of macular degeneration, a common problem in people over age fifty. Macular degeneration causes a loss of central vision. It does not immediately lead to complete blindness but can prevent you from driving, reading, recognizing faces, and performing daily tasks.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you notice any of these changes, get a dilated eye examination from an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) as soon as you can. The doctor may be able to treat this problem and prevent further vision loss. Early treatment is necessary.

            The sudden onset of seeing many spots before your eyes can be an urgent warning that you should seek medical evaluation.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Seeing spots can be caused by a variety of medical problems. Some spots are normal, like seeing blood vessels when you are staring up at a blue sky or seeing spots for just a second when you stand up quickly. Some are essentially meaningless, like a floater that drifts across your vision and moves away when you try to focus on it. However, some are important and may precede a serious event such as blindness.
            </p>

            <p>
                One such condition is an outpouching of the blood vessels of the retina (the back part of the eye where vision is recorded and transmitted to the brain), called retinal microaneurysm. In a more advanced eye disease, for example, one caused by diabetes, new abnormal blood vessels grow and are at risk of rupturing. If these vessels rupture, blood can flow inside the eye, causing the sudden and severe loss of vision.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, if you notice the onset of many spots in your field of vision, contact an ophthalmologist immediately. Since these symptoms may be associated with diabetes, diabetics should have their eyes checked every year to find and treat any abnormal growths of the blood vessels and prevent the complications that cause these symptoms.

        <div class="tip_contents">
            You may notice little spots or strings floating across your vision. If there is a change in the number or appearance of the floaters or if flashes appear, you should call your eye doctor immediately. They may be the warning signs of a retinal detachment tear, or hemorrhage.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Most of us experience floaters from time to time and some people have more than others. They are caused when the clear jelly inside the eyeball shrinks with age. This jelly, called the vitreous, can tug on the retina of the eye, releasing a few cells or strings of cells. These are the spots and threads we see when we look at a white wall or a blue sky. The tugging can also cause little electrical currents to flash. 
            </p>

            <p>
                But if you see a change in floaters or any flashes of light, it might be a sign of retinal detachment, which could cause sudden, permanent vision loss or blindness. If you see your eye doctor (an ophthalmologist) immediately, you may be able to save your vision. Don’t delay. If you can’t reach an eye doctor, go to the emergency room.
