            If you have upper-middle belly pain (with or without bloody vomit and black tarry stools), you may have an ulcer. Smoking makes stomach ulcers worse. It also increases your risk of stomach cancer.
        </div>
<div class="body_contents">
<p>
                Smoking may cause ulcers, and it definitely slows the healing of stomach and duodenal ulcers that are already present. Nicotine is an active drug that has a direct, injurious effect on the lining of the stomach and duodenum, and ulcers can consequently develop without healing.
            </p>
<p>
                Stop smoking, especially if stomach and duodenal ulcers are a problem. You are at a higher risk of hemorrhage, ulcers bursting into the belly cavity, esophageal and stomach cancers, and blockages in the arteries that supply the intestines with blood. Seek medical evaluation and treatment. If you are vomiting blood or have black tarry stools, you need emergency medical care. (See Tip 125 for more information on black tarry stools and life-threatening bleeds.)
            </p>
<p>
                Note: The combination of smoking and drinking alcohol puts you at a much greater risk of developing these problems.
