            If your pulse drops below 50 beats per minute, there may be a serious impairment in your heartâ€™s pacing system that could cause serious symptoms such as light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, or sudden loss of consciousness. Although some well-conditioned athletes may  normally have a resting pulse below 50, a pulse lower than 40 in an athlete is a reason to seek medical attention  immediately.

<p>
                Your heartbeat is regulated by specialized heart cells located in the upper chamber on the right side of the heart. If this area becomes diseased (or altered as a side effect of medication), it may begin to function abnormally, causing a sudden slowing of the pulse. Common medications that slow your heart rate include heart drugs like digoxin, beta-blockers like metoprolol or atenolol, and calcium channel blockers like verapamil or diltiazem.
            </p>

                The slow pulse may be so severe it causes you to pass out, or it may occur intermittently, with your pulse returning to normal for a while. If this is occurring even for short periods of time, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.
