                <p><b>Blood Tests</b></p>
                <ul>
                            <li>At ages one and two all children should have their hematocrit checked (to screen for anemia: a low blood count). The hematocrit test measures the proportion of red blood cells in the individual’s total blood content.</li>
                            <li>If there’s a family history of high cholesterol and/or heart disease, consider having your child’s blood cholesterol level checked at age two. Many doctors recommend that every child get screened before he or she reaches adolescence, or at least once at age twenty.</li>
                            <li>Consider having your child’s blood tested for lead content, especially if you live in an older home. Lead poisoning can contribute to growth problems, learning disabilities, and anemia in children. Most lead poisoning in children results from ingesting paint chips or dirt contaminated with lead, which was an ingredient used in house paint prior to 1977.</li>

                <p><b>Type 2 Diabetes</b></p>
                Considering the growing diabetes epidemic and how diabetes is becoming more common in children, many public health experts are suggesting that children with weight problems be closely monitored for this disease. Risk factors include obesity, having a close relative with type 2 diabetes, ethnicity (Native American, African American, Hispanic American, or Asian/South Pacific Island ancestry), and existing conditions that may indicate insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, dyslipidemia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, etc.). Parents can lower a child’s risk of developing diabetes by encouraging healthy eating habits and activity choices.

                <p><b>Alcohol and Drug Use</b></p>
                Between the ages of eleven and twenty-one, juveniles should be assessed for the risk of developing alcohol and drug abuse patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
                <p><b>Depression and Thoughts of Suicide</b></p>
                Screening teenagers for their mental health should be a routine part of the adolescent history and physical exam. Suicide is the third most common cause of death among teenagers. Early identification and treatment of depression is thought to be the most effective way to prevent this tragedy. Between the ages of eleven and thirteen, children should spend quality time with their doctor, developing a safe environment to ask questions and seek help. The physician can screen for drug, alcohol, sexual, and mental factors.
