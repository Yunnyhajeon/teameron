            If your child develops signs of puberty too early, he or she should be evaluated. Signs of puberty may include rapid growth, hair growth (pubic and armpit), acne, and adult body odor, as well as breast enlargement and the onset of menstruation in girls or increasing genitalia size, a deepening voice, and growth of facial hair in boys. These signs can be due to an infection, a hormone problem, a tumor, a brain abnormality, or a brain injury.

                Signs of puberty are considered abnormal when developed under the age of eight years in girls and nine in boys. Precocious or early puberty has many non-serious causes, and in certain cases thereâ€™s no known cause. However, it is important to rule out infections, tumors, brain abnormalities, brain injuries, or hormonal problems. Take your child to the doctor for assessment and possible investigation. Early diagnosis may be life-saving.
