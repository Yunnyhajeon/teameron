            Agonizing belly pain that worsens with any movement, accompanied by rigid belly muscles, especially in a person with a history of ulcers of  the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine), is often a sign of a perforated ulcer.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Ulcer problems have a reputation for being long-standing, with frequent bouts of belly discomfort, including pain, indigestion, a feeling of fullness, nausea, and other symptoms. If you have ulcers, you may have gotten used to this discomfort by intermittently taking pills during severe bouts of pain.
            </p>

            <p>
                This situation sets the stage for the ulcer to progress, eroding deeper and deeper into the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine, just below the stomach), until a hole is formed. When this perforation occurs, stomach contents are released into the belly cavity along with gas or air. Severe internal bleeding may also occur. This causes immediate, agonizing abdominal pain that worsens with any movement. Also, you may experience abdominal muscle spasms: The stomach contents will cause intense tissue reaction in the belly lining, resulting in a reflex belly muscle spasm with board-like muscle rigidity. The belly area will thus feel like a solid board instead of soft to the touch.
            </p>

            <p>
                This condition requires immediate medical attention at an emergency room.

            An ulcer in the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine, just below the stomach) often causes pain in the upper-middle area of the belly, with or without bloody vomit and black tarry stools. It may wake you from sleep.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                An ulcer is a sore on the lining of the stomach or duodenum. It can cause pain if it penetrates the wall or causes a spasm. (Some ulcers are painless.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Inside the stomach the chemical hydrochloric acid and associated enzymes can change a piece of meat (or any food) from solid to liquid. The stomach and duodenum contain a mucous coating that covers the lining of their walls. This coating prevents the acid and enzymes from dissolving the stomach wall itself. Various substances—including nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, aspirin, some pain medicines such as ibuprofen (acetaminophen does not cause ulcers), and certain bacteria (see Tip 97)—diminish these defenses, causing ulcers to form. Also, people with hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism occasionally develop ulcers. (See Tip 187 for more about parathyroid conditions.) Note: Taking blood-thinning products, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and warfarin (Coumadin), while you are taking aspirin increases the chance that you will bleed internally, particularly if you have an existing ulcer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Bleeding into the duodenum may result in black tarry stools that are very sticky. Vomiting is also associated with the irritation caused by ulcers. Early medical treatment is necessary to prevent potentially life-threatening consequences, such as bleeding and perforation.

            Mild or severe upper-middle or left belly pain extending into the back with nausea and/or vomiting may be caused by pancreatitis. The pain is often less severe when sitting up and bending forward, while it worsens when lying flat on your back. Severe cases can cause diabetes, release dangerous chemicals into the blood, and produce internal hemorrhaging. Consumption of alcohol and foods high in fat content can cause this condition or make it much worse.

                The pancreas is a narrow, band-like organ one to two inches wide, extending behind the stomach across the upper belly area for three to six inches toward the left side. It has two major functions: to produce enzymes for the small intestine to digest food, and to make insulin, which is then dispatched into the bloodstream. If the pancreas gets inflamed, the release of its potent enzymes into the bloodstream or the surrounding tissues can make you very ill, causing internal bleeding and widespread tissue damage throughout the body. Destruction of the pancreas can also cause diabetes, since the hormone insulin is necessary to drive sugar from the bloodstream into body cells. Lack of insulin production causes hyperglycemia (high sugar levels in the blood).
            </p>

            <p>
                The pancreas can become inflamed as a consequence of gallbladder disease. The gallbladder has a tube in common with the pancreas; if gallstones pass into this tube, they can block the outflow of the digestive chemicals from the pancreas. You can also damage your pancreas by regularly drinking alcohol; if your pancreas becomes inflamed, you should stop drinking alcohol forever. The mumps virus is another possible cause of pancreatitis. The pancreas can sometimes become inflamed without any identifiable cause.
            </p>

            <p>
                The symptoms of pancreatitis warrant emergency medical evaluation and treatment, in order to avoid serious complications. Blood studies can document damage in the pancreas.

            A common, often curable, cause of recurrent ulcers of the stomach and duodenum is infection of their lining by a germ called H. pylori. The red light warning signals of this type of infection are episodes of upper-middle belly pain, with or without vomiting blood and/or passing black tarry stools.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                For many years it was thought that stress caused ulcers. Relieve the stress, and the ulcer would heal, only to come again when the stress level was again increased. This is no longer considered totally correct.
            </p>

            <p>
                The exact effect of stress on the development of ulcers has not been determined, but it is now known that a common cause of recurrent ulcers of the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) is infection by a microscopic, rod-shaped germ called <i>Helicobacter pylori.</i> This discovery has, in many ways, revolutionized the treatment of ulcers. Antibiotics will eradicate the bacteria and prevent ulcers. Typically, the use of at least two antibiotics simultaneously, in addition to the medication used to shut off the acid in the stomach, treats the infection, achieves ulcer healing, and stops additional ulcers from forming.
            </p>

            <p>
                Yet major questions arise. If an ulcer is caused by an infection, where did the infection come from, and how can you protect yourself from getting it again? At the present time, we have no definite answers to these questions. H. pylori occurs worldwide and is apparently acquired from the intake of contaminated food or water. But it is not known how to detect food contamination or how to kill the germ when preparing food. It is possible that it can be transmitted from one person to another within a household.
            </p>

            <p>
                A doctor can determine if you have ulcers caused by H. pylori by looking into your stomach and duodenum with a special tube called a gastroscope. He or she will obtain a piece of the stomach lining (a biopsy) and will examine it for the H. pylori germs. In addition, there is a test that uses breath analysis to detect a by-product of the infection and, more recently, a blood test and stool test have been developed to detect the presence of the germ.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, if you have an ulcer with heartburn (the backup of stomach acid into the esophagus), you should continue to avoid foods that cause these symptoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ulceration can lead to serious hemorrhage as well as rupture of the stomach or duodenum, so it is very important to be evaluated and treated for this condition as soon as possible. If you are vomiting blood or passing black tarry stools, you should be seen on an emergency basis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Persons with H. pylori are at increased risk of developing certain cancers: possibly an adenocarcinoma and definitely a MALT lymphoma.

            If you experience upper-middle belly pain (with or without vomiting blood and/or passing black tarry stools), you may have an ulcer or inflammation in the stomach and/or an ulcer in the duodenum. Drinking alcohol may increase the risk of developing ulcers and also prevent the healing of ulcers that are already present. It can also make pancreatitis worse, increasing the possibility of fatal complications.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Alcohol is rapidly absorbed through the stomach lining and causes acid and enzymes to pour into the stomach in large volumes. The presence of excess amounts of these chemicals can lead to inflammation of the stomach, the formation of ulcers, and/or progression of ulcers already present.
            </p>

            <p>
                When ulcers or inflammation of the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) are a problem, abstinence from drinking is important. Alcohol may relieve the belly pain momentarily, but the condition will eventually worsen because alcohol consumption increases the risk that the ulcer will bleed and/or perforate in the abdominal cavity. Black tarry stools are often a sign of ulcers bleeding into the stomach or intestines.
            </p>

            <p>
                Belly pain associated with pancreatitis from alcohol intake is potentially life-threatening. The pancreas, located in the upper belly, produces insulin to control blood sugar and the very caustic chemicals (or enzymes) that help in food digestion. When pancreatitis occurs, the substances that digest food begin to digest the pancreas itself. These caustic chemicals may also be released into the bloodstream with life-threatening consequences.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you drink a large quantity of alcohol and suddenly develop nausea, vomiting, and severe belly pain, you are at risk of tearing the inside of your esophagus. This can cause severe bleeding and dehydration. Seek medical care to evaluate and treat this ailment and to get advice on how to stop drinking.
            </p>

            <p>
                Belly pain with bleeding—vomiting blood or excreting black tarry stools—requires emergency medical care. (See Tip 125 for more information on black tarry stools and life-threatening bleeds.) Upper-middle and/or upper-left belly pain that extends to the back can be a sign of pancreatitis and also requires emergency medical care. (See Tip 96 for more information on pancreatitis.)
            </p>

            <p>
                Note: The combination of drinking alcohol and smoking puts you at a much greater risk of developing these problems.

                Smoking may cause ulcers, and it definitely slows the healing of stomach and duodenal ulcers that are already present. Nicotine is an active drug that has a direct, injurious effect on the lining of the stomach and duodenum, and ulcers can consequently develop without healing.

            <p>
                Stop smoking, especially if stomach and duodenal ulcers are a problem.

            Upper-middle belly pain, bloody vomit, and/or black tarry stools can be caused by certain pain pills. These medicines can cause ulceration of the stomach and duodenum, which may  lead  to  the hemorrhaging and bursting of the stomach in the area of the ulcer. This problem has resulted in as many as 7,600 deaths in one year in the United States.

                Aspirin, ibuprofen, Advil, Nuprin, Motrin, BC Powder, Goody’s, and other similar medicines (known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs) are heavily marketed for general pain relief and the relief of the joint pain caused by arthritis. The same medicines are prescribed by doctors in higher dosages for arthritis and other bone and muscle pains. Irritation and ulceration caused by long-term use of these drugs can be life-threatening when it results in hemorrhaging into the stomach or duodenum. You will develop bloody vomit, vomit that resembles coffee grounds in appearance, and/or black tarry bowel movements. Also, the ulcers can burst, causing corrosive chemicals in the stomach to leak into the belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Take these medications only if necessary and only as directed. If you are experiencing belly pain, see your doctor immediately so that you can be evaluated and treated. There are other medications that your doctor can prescribe, along with drugs to prevent ulcer formation. Also, if you are already taking the blood thinners clopidogrel (Plavix) or warfarin (Coumadin), do not take any NSAIDs without first talking to your doctor. The combination of these medicines increases the chance of bleeding. If you experience belly discomfort and are vomiting blood, or if you note black tarry stools, seek emergency medical care.

            Pain in the upper-right and/or middle belly area (with or without nausea and vomiting), often an hour or two after eating fatty foods, may be due to gallstones. If the upper-right belly becomes tender and the pain persists, and/or you develop a fever, the gallbladder may be infected.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The gallbladder is located in the upper-right area of the belly, under the liver. It serves as a reservoir for bile, a substance made by the liver to help digest fat and protein. When a fatty meal passes through the stomach and enters the first part of the small intestine (the duodenum), a hormone is released that stimulates the gallbladder to squeeze bile through the bile duct into the intestine. When bile is stored in the teardrop-shaped gallbladder, stones sometimes form. These stones may be forced into the gallbladder’s narrow neck when it contracts (squeezes). As it attempts to force the stones through its duct opening, it develops spasms, causing severe pain in the upper-right area of the belly. Nausea, vomiting, and distention in the upper-right belly area are often present as well. The pain may be constant or intermittent, and may occur more often after eating meals high in fat content. Note: Gallstones are most commonly seen in obese women in their forties who have had several children.
            </p>

            <p>
                If a gallstone is impacted in the neck of the gallbladder (like a cork in a bottle), the gallbladder will balloon out, become infected, and sometimes rupture. If a gallstone passes from the gallbladder neck into the common bile duct (a tube-like structure leading from the liver to the intestine) and blocks it, yellow jaundice will occur. Your skin and/or the white part of your eyes will turn yellow from the yellow bile backing up into your liver and bloodstream, spreading to all parts of your body. Blockage of the common bile duct can cause infection and/or even death.
            </p>

            <p>
                Removal of the stones can save your life. Usually, the whole gallbladder is removed, using a fairly simple technique called laparoscopy, which involves inserting a special type of scope into the belly cavity.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience symptoms even after your gallbladder has been removed, seek medical evaluation. In rare cases, gallstones can form in certain tubes inside of the liver. These can be removed with a procedure called endoscopy, in which a tiny camera device is inserted into the small intestine to help remove the stones.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                If you experience upper-right belly pain often after eating fatty foods, with or without nausea and vomiting, seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Fever indicates infection requiring immediate treatment. (See Tip 128 for more information on gallbladder disease.)

            Mild tenderness over the liver (the right upper area of the belly, just under the ribs), swelling of the ankles and/or belly, and yellow jaundice may be signs of hepatitis. Drinking alcoholic beverages to excess, and/or over a long period of time, can cause or worsen liver disease that leads to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and death.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Drinking alcoholic beverages (whether liquor, beer, or wine) may cause injury to the liver. When an alcoholic beverage is consumed, the alcohol is rapidly absorbed through the stomach and small intestinal wall into the bloodstream. The breakdown of alcohol occurs mainly in the liver, where certain byproducts cause alcoholic hepatitis, or inflammation in the liver cells. These cells may be destroyed and replaced with scars. The condition of a scarred liver is called cirrhosis. When enough liver cells are destroyed, liver failure and death follow. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The onset of liver cell inflammation from alcohol can be subtle, producing few symptoms. Instead of severe liver pain, you may feel mild tenderness over the liver and occasional nausea. As the inflammation and scarring progress, swelling will develop, first in the ankles and legs. Subsequently there will be swelling in the belly as fluid accumulates there. Liver failure will cause yellow jaundice and dark, tea-colored urine from the backup of yellow bile, which is made in the liver. This condition is readily diagnosable by a physician during a physical examination, with a blood test that measures liver enzymes, radiological studies, and sometimes a liver biopsy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Liver inflammation is not a disease of “drunks.” You do not have to be a heavy drinker to develop this condition. You may say, “I don’t drink the hard stuff,” or “I limit my drinking to beer,” but this type of liver inflammation occurs in beer drinkers just as often as it does in liquor and wine drinkers. Alcoholic hepatitis, even when it is so severe that you turn yellow, can be reversed if you eliminate your alcoholic intake early enough and medical treatment is instituted. The consequence of restarting alcohol intake is often cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), causing liver failure and death. Cancer of the liver is also more common in patients with cirrhosis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Individuals with any type of non-alcohol-related hepatitis (especially hepatitis C) are very sensitive to alcohol intake. It may increase liver inflammation and hasten the progression of liver destruction, resulting in cirrhosis. If you have liver disease, or if you have ever had alcoholic liver disease, do not drink any alcoholic beverages. Your doctor can help you stop. If you have cirrhosis, also be sure to avoid Tylenol (acetaminophen) and any other over-the-counter medication containing acetaminophen or any herbal product without first talking to your doctor. Many other medicines can further damage a cirrhotic liver. Always check with your doctor and/or pharmacist to make certain that all your medications are safe to take.

            An injury to the belly area can result in damage to the spleen, and a subsequent life-threatening internal hemorrhage many days after the accident. The warning signals may be worsening or recurring upper-left belly pain, often accompanied by left shoulder pain, and/or suddenly feeling weak or faint. These symptoms may be experienced many days after the injury.

            <p>
                The spleen is a spongy structure that is structurally similar to a grape, but is larger in size (it has a soft interior, and is covered by a capsule). Located in the upper-left area of the belly cavity, the spleen contains a large quantity of red and white blood cells. A severe blow to the belly area, from an incident such as an auto accident or a sports injury, may damage your spleen. Sudden weakness and/or fainting may indicate a life-threatening internal hemorrhage. If you have these symptoms after this type of injury, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately. (See Tip 7 for more information on dizziness and life-threatening internal bleeding.) 
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, however, the injury damages the capsule of the spleen, and there is a bulging out of the internal spongy material. The bulging contents may slowly continue to come out, eventually causing profuse bleeding. It can take several days for this to happen, so you may initially experience pain, and then the pain may go away and come back. Or you may develop an upper-left belly pain, which persists and worsens, and is accompanied by pain in your left shoulder—due to the nerve connections running on the inside of your back between the spleen and the left shoulder. Alternatively, you may suddenly become weak and faint hours or even days after the injury. It is very important to watch out for any of these symptoms after a blunt injury to the belly area. Recurring or worsening pain in the upper-left belly area, with or without left shoulder pain, deserves immediate attention at an emergency room.

            If you are middle-aged or older and you have sudden lower-left belly pain with intermittent constipation or diarrhea, you may have diverticulitis. In most cases, the pain is persistent. Sometimes, though rarely, it can occur on the right side. If untreated, diverticulitis can cause the colon to rupture, requiring emergency surgery.

                About 25 to 30 percent of Americans over fifty years old have diverticulosis (outpouchings in the colon wall). Diverticula are the small pouches that may be formed in the walls of the colon. As the colon squeezes the breakdown products of food to form stools, weakened areas of the colon wall bulge out, forming these dead-end paths. Note: Some doctors think that this disease is sometimes inherited.
            </p>

                Diverticula can become irritated and infected (a condition called diverticulitis) from stool that becomes lodged in these pockets and affects the integrity of the lining of the colon. If the infected diverticula burst, the infected material can spread throughout the belly cavity, causing pus pockets; drainage to the skin, bladder, etc.; scarring; and/or blockage of the bowel. Each of these conditions requires emergency surgery. Initially, the sole symptom of this condition may be mild lower-left belly pain. Diverticulitis can usually be treated with antibiotics. You can decrease your chances of developing diverticula by eating high-fiber foods (grains, fruits, and vegetables) and drinking lots of liquids to avoid constipation.

                If you develop sudden lower-left belly pain, especially with a fever, seek immediate medical evaluation.

            Mild lower belly pain or pain during sexual intercourse may be due to an infection of the female organs by a germ called chlamydia or other germs, including the gonorrhea germ. These bacteria can cause significant damage to the fallopian tubes and lead to infertility. They can also cause a life-threatening internal hemorrhage from a tubal pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The symptoms may be few, but scarring from this type of infection can block the fallopian tube, through which the egg passes, causing infertility. Also, the scarring can interfere with the small fingerlike projections located at the end of the fallopian tubes, which pick up the egg when it bursts from the ovary each month. If it’s not treated early, this may lead to infertility.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fertilization normally occurs when an egg travels along the fallopian tube to its midportion and meets with sperm. After fertilization, the egg has approximately three days to travel through the rest of the tube into the cavity of the womb, where it grows on the wall and gets nourishment from the mother’s body. If this trip is delayed by scarring from infections, the fertilized egg will attach in the wall of the tube and begin to grow there. Growth of the embryo can proceed only to a limited size (usually reached at six to eight weeks from the beginning of pregnancy) before the tube ruptures, with the potential of a life-threatening hemorrhage. Lower belly pain, weakness, dizziness, and a rapid pulse may indicate that this rupture has occurred. It requires emergency surgery.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to know when your female organs are infected in order to prevent damage to your tubes, ovaries, and uterus. Mild discomfort in the lower belly or pain during sexual intercourse may be the only clues that infection is present, though it can usually be detected by testing at the mouth of the womb. Regular checkups with your doctor provide an opportunity for early detection. (See Appendix C, page 377, for more information about sexually transmitted diseases.) If you think you have had sexual contact with someone infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea, or if you have any of these subtle symptoms, tell your doctor as soon as possible.

            Red light warning signals of a rare but serious infection called toxic shock syndrome are lower belly pain and a high fever, often with a bright red rash  spreading  from  mid-body  to  all  over the body, and a “strawberry”-appearing tongue. Any severe vaginal infection (sometimes associated with the use of tampons) may lead to this ailment.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                First observed in young menstruating women, toxic shock syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal ailment. The onset of the infection is sudden and it rapidly progresses from a high fever and diarrhea with lower belly pain to a dramatic drop in blood pressure and death.
            </p>

            <p>
                This disease is more common in women who use tampons, especially when they leave them in for longer than normal periods of time. (It is recommended that tampons be changed every four to eight hours and not be used continuously throughout the menstrual cycle.) Improper use may contribute to the development of the infection, which is caused by a rare strain of commonly occurring bacteria. Severe vaginal infections may be a clue that this ailment is present.
            </p>

            <p>
                If treatment with antibiotics begins early, you can fully recover. If you have a high fever, lower belly pain, and a vaginal infection, you should go to an emergency room.

            The red light warning signals of lower belly pain, lower back pain, and problems with urination— such as slowing of the urine flow, increased frequency, a feeling of urgency to urinate, and/or pain on urination—indicate many different possible ailments for men. Infections of the urinary tract are important to recognize early since they can cause serious kidney disease if left untreated (see Tip 130). These symptoms can also be a sign of prostatitis or, rarely, prostate cancer.

                If you have an infected prostate gland (prostatitis), you may experience long-term pain and tenderness in the lower belly, pain in the lower back, or pain in the area behind the scrotum. You may also experience a burning sensation when you urinate and a slowing in the flow of your urine. When the prostate swells, it causes these symptoms by pushing against the urethra (the tube leading from the bladder through the penis to the outside). Prostatitis may appear with an inability to urinate and (rarely) with aching all over your body and a sudden high fever. The swollen prostate may be detected during a rectal exam, which would prompt further testing to make the diagnosis of prostatitis. Antibiotics are often the prescribed treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                A person with advanced prostate cancer may also find that he has difficulty urinating, and that he experiences a slowing of the urine flow, with dribbling after completion. The most common cause of these symptoms is a benign growth of the prostate gland, but pay close attention. When it is prostate cancer, there are usually few symptoms in the early stages. It can become advanced before it is detected. The PSA (Prostate Specific Antigen) blood test helps in the early detection of prostate cancer. All men age fifty and older (or forty and older for African-American men or those who have a first-degree relative with a history of prostate cancer) should receive a PSA test and a digital rectal exam annually. (See Appendix C, page 379, for details about this screening.)

            <p>
                Prostate cancer is much more common in men over sixty years of age, but it can also occur in younger men. In general, when you are old and get prostate cancer, the disease will act old as well in that it is usually slower growing and less aggressive than when you are younger. However, while it is less likely to spread and become fatal, there have been some cases of aggressive prostate cancer in older men.

            Lower-right belly pain and tenderness may indicate appendicitis. Appendicitis is a serious disease that can be fatal if the appendix ruptures.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Typically an early diagnosis of appendicitis allows it to be cured via surgery. But without proper treatment, the appendix can rupture, causing infection to spread throughout the belly cavity. This can be fatal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix, a fingershaped structure projecting from the first part of the colon. Swelling and inflammation at the spot where the appendix is attached to the colon can block its blood supply, leading to gangrene in its tip and, ultimately, its rupture.
            </p>

            <p>
                Appendicitis often causes a bellyache. This pain may be vague and dispersed throughout the belly, and then will often (but not always) localize to the lower-right area of the belly, which will become tender to the touch. This usually occurs over a forty-eight-hour period and will continue to get worse until the appendix ruptures, at which time the pain may lessen. A sudden reduction of your pain may mean that your condition is actually worse, not better.
            </p>

            <p>
                The pain of appendicitis is occasionally located in other areas, including the right side of the lower back (if the appendix projects up the back side of the colon) or the upper-right belly (if the first part of the colon is displaced to this area, as during pregnancy).
            </p>

            <p>
                Other tip-offs that may accompany appendicitis include a low-grade fever (not usually over 101.5 degrees), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or constipation. If you suspect appendicitis, you should go to an emergency room for immediate  medical evaluation.

            Any woman who notices persistent and/or unexplained bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, and/or feeling full more quickly should be evaluated by a physician. While these symptoms have many common causes that are not serious, they could also be the first symptoms of life-threatening conditions such as ovarian or other types of cancer. Identifying the source early can improve the odds of successful treatment.

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                Bloating, pressure, and/or discomfort or pain in the abdomen are possible symptoms of ovarian cancer. Others include feeling full more quickly than normal, having trouble eating, and having to urinate often and/or urgently. These relatively common symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions such as urinary tract infections or irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms may even be caused by totally innocuous conditions—like the bloating regularly experienced around menstruation or the discomfort caused by an overactive bladder. However, you may want to see a gynecologist to rule out ovarian cancer if these problems are new, severe, and occur continuously for several weeks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Any woman who has reached sexual maturity should begin to see her family physician or gynecologist on a regular basis to be screened for ovarian cancer. It should be part of her routine health maintenance. During a pelvic exam, the doctor will check the size and shape of the ovaries. However, ovarian tumors are difficult to identify early because the ovaries are situated deep within the body. If you have a high risk of this type of cancer, your doctor will likely suggest additional testing.
            </p>

            <p>
                Risk factors for ovarian cancer include:
                <ul>
                    <li>A strong family history of ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer</li>
                    <li>Increasing age (usually after menopause)</li>
                    <li>Obesity</li>
                    <li>Starting menstruation early (before twelve years of age)</li>
                    <li>Having no children or having the first child after the age of thirty</li>
                    <li>Going through menopause late (mid-fifties)</li>
                    <li>Taking fertility drugs</li>
                    <li>A personal history of breast cancer</li>
                    <li>Undergoing estrogen and other hormone replacement therapy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                If your doctor suspects ovarian cancer, he/she may use one or a combination of methods to evaluate you, such as a transvaginal ultrasound, CT scan, barium enema X-ray, colonoscopy, MRI, PET scan, laparoscopy (pictures taken of the ovaries and other pelvic organs through a tube placed in the lower abdomen), biopsy (tissue sampling), and blood tests. (For more information on ovarian cancer screening, see Appendix C.)
