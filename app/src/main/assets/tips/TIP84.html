            The red light warning signals that you may have a rapid or irregular heartbeat are: heart palpitations,
            fluttering, skipped or pounding beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, a feeling like
            “squirrels running around in the chest,” and a feeling like your heart is beating at the base of your
            throat. If you think your heartbeat is abnormally fast, slow, or irregular, take your pulse. An abnormal
            pulse can be a warning sign of many different life-threatening illnesses.

                If you feel that your heart is beating abnormally, take your pulse. To do so, take the pads of your
                second and third fingers, place them on the thumb side of your wrist, and find the pulsations of the
                artery. If your hand is palm up, the pulse is between the bone and the first big tendon (see Figure 8).
            </p>
            <p>
                Count the number of pulsations you feel in one minute:
                <ul>
                    <li>A normal rate is usually between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Normal ranges of resting rates
                        vary from person to person. In other words, if your normal rate is 60 to 70, an abnormally high
                        rate for you may be 90. Or if a normal resting rate for you is 85 to 95, then an abnormally slow
                        rate might be 60. It is a good idea to check your pulse a few times while at rest so that you
                        get to know the general range of your pulse.</li>
                    <li>A fast rate is a rate above your normal resting rate. Note: A resting rate above 100 is abnormal
                        for anyone.</li>
                    <li>A resting heart rate is considered slow when it is below your normal range. For most people, a
                        rate below 60 beats per minute is slow.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
