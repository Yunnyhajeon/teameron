            A child who suddenly develops a harsh noisy sound when breathing in (called stridor) that does not go away when he or she is at rest should be seen immediately in the emergency room. However, if the stridor is from an inhaled object, it requires emergency first aid (see Appendix A, page 350). Croup (a "seal-like" barking cough) also requires an emergency room visit.

                Sudden onset of stridor is usually associated with difficulty breathing. The most serious cause used to be an infection of the epiglottis (the “hinged” flap over the windpipe that stops food from entering the lungs when you swallow). This is very rare now thanks to Hib immunization, which protects children from the germ responsible for this problem. In the case of a sudden onset of stridor, do not administer first aid for choking because this could make the condition worse. Do not put your fingers in his or her mouth. The first thing to do is to walk outside with your child if it is cool out, or open the freezer door and sit in the cool air. Even if his or her condition does improve with cool air, go to the emergency room.

                Frequently, the stridor will get better when the child calms down, but he or she should still be seen by a physician as soon as possible. Croup and inhaled objects are the remaining most common causes of stridor. If you suspect that an infant has inhaled an object (such as a coin, peanut, little toy, hard candy, piece of popcorn, carrot, or battery) and if he/she has a sudden onset of difficulty breathing, immediately administer emergency first aid. (See Appendix A, for basic instructions.)

                Croup is a viral infection around the voice box that typically causes a seal-like, barking kind of cough that gradually worsens. It is important to notify the child’s pediatrician if he or she develops this type of cough. However, if a younger child with this ailment develops noisy breathing that does not get better when the child quiets down, it may be lifethreatening. Keep the child as calm as possible (agitation worsens the condition), and get him or her to an emergency room immediately. Do not administer first aid for choking because this could make the condition worse.

            While stridor is caused by the swelling—and thus narrowing—of the airway, croup is caused by an irritation of the airway. Croup can turn into stridor in certain cases.
