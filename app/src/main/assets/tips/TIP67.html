            Shortness of breath when you lie flat in bed, which wakes you up in the middle of the night and improves
            when you sit up, is often a sign of heart failure.

                The heart is one big muscle that pumps blood through your body. If the pump begins to fail, fluid can
                back up into your lungs and cause shortness of breath. Some people describe the feeling of shortness of
                breath as a feeling of drowning. In the early stages of heart failure, excessive shortness of breath
                comes only when you exercise, climb stairs, walk uphill, and/or are lying flat in bed or sleeping on one
                pillow. This is related to a shift in your body’s fluids. When you are erect or sitting, fluid
                accumulates in the dependent parts of your body—your lower legs and your feet. People with heart failure
                who have excess fluid will often experience swelling of their legs, ankles, and feet during the day when
                they are in an upright position. This may go unnoticed because it produces no discomfort. But when you
                are lying flat, the fluid from your legs is returned into circulation and to the heart, which is too
                weak to pump it all, causing the fluid to shift to the lungs.

                The scientific name for this condition is PND (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), which means intermittent
                shortness of breath at night. You go to sleep, wake up short of breath, sit up, and breathe better, only
                to lie back down and get short of breath again. You may eventually need to sleep on two or three
                pillows. If the condition gets bad enough, you may have to sit up in a chair all night.

                There are many causes of heart failure. When any symptoms of heart failure appear, including nighttime
                shortness of breath, it is urgent that the cause be found. Evaluation and treatment can be life-saving.
