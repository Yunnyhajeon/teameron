                During routine physical checkups your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and take a health history that includes questions about smoking. If you have symptoms of shortness of breath and respiratory problems, your doctor may suggest pulmonary function testing to help diagnose asthma and other lung ailments. This involves breathing in and out of a machine to measure the volume of air that you inhale and exhale. </p>
                <p>

If you are a smoker, have been exposed to a lot of asbestos or other toxic airborne substances, or the doctor suspects that you have pneumonia or fluid in your lungs, he/she may recommend that you get a chest X-ray or chest CT scan. There is no uniform opinion concerning how often to get these screening tests or whether it’s valuable to get them at all. There are cases in which these tests—especially the CT scan—have picked up the disease early, allowing for a cure. However, there are also cases where an abnormality is discovered, resulting in invasive diagnostic interventions (with the associated complications from these procedures) that fail to uncover a medical problem.

            <p><b>Early Detection of Cancer in the GI Tract</b></p>
            <p>
Whether you have risk factors or not, routine colorectal screenings are generally recommended starting at a minimum of age fifty. Both men and women without any risk factors should be examined with a colonoscope (colonoscopy) every ten years. Various health committees have recommended other options for screening, such as sigmoidoscopy and barium enemas, but many experts of the GI tract (gastroenterologists) feel that colonoscopies are more likely to identify any cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
At a minimum, you should get a special test called a fecal occult blood test every year. This is a test that is performed at home at three different times to detect whether there is blood in your stools. It is much less accurate than a colonoscopy, but is also less costly and intrusive. If blood is detected, additional tests are needed. Of course, any test may miss curable cancers, so the decision about which test to use (colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, etc.) as a screen for colon cancer should be made with your personal risk factors in mind. Your doctor can help you decide which test is most appropriate for you.
            </p>
            <p>
You should talk to your doctor about when to start and how often to undergo screening if you have risk factors including:
