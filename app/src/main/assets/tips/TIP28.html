            Infections of the upper lip or nose can be dangerous and may spread to the inside of the head.

                You’ve heard of the Bermuda Triangle and its dangers, but you may not have heard of the “dangerous triangle”.  The body has one, and it has perils as well. The apex or tip of the triangle is at the forehead between the eyebrows. The angles of the triangle are at the corners of the mouth.
            </p>
<p>
                This triangle differs from other areas of the face and head in one very important way: Blood brought to this area by the arteries will return to the heart through the veins that travel inside the skull rather than the ones that reside outside the skull. Why is this important? Germs that have gained entrance to the circulation in this location have a direct route to the brain and other structures inside the skull. Infections in the brain can quickly spread to the vital centers responsible for normal life functions, and can therefore be fatal.

                An infected bump, boil, or any infection on the upper lip or inside or outside of the nose holds a greater threat of serious complications than many infections elsewhere on the face or head. Signs of infection are tenderness, warmth, swelling, and redness. When they occur, see your doctor as soon as possible. Due to the seriousness of infection in this locale, you should not delay seeking treatment by using home remedies, except for the most mild surface sores. Picking or squeezing the infected area can spread the infection. <i>Do not</i> pop pimples in this area.
