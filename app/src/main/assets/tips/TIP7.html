            Passing out or nearly passing out, with the feeling of light-headedness when you sit up or try to stand, is
            often the result of a drop in blood pressure (orthostatic hypotension). The potentially life-threatening
            causes of this condition include internal hemorrhage, serious heart irregularities, and severe dehydration.
            These symptoms can also occur as side effects of certain medications.

                A constant and uninterrupted flow of blood is required by all of your body’s organs. The brain is the
                first organ to fail without nutrition and oxygen from the blood, so even a slight change in blood flow
                to the brain will produce symptoms such as dizziness or fainting.

                When you sit up from lying down or when you stand from a sitting position, your blood vessels and heart
                automatically adjust by narrowing the vessels below the heart and widening the vessels above the heart
                that supply the brain, assuring that there will be adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain.
                If there is not enough blood or fluid in your circulation because of bleeding or dehydration, these
                automatic adjustments will not provide adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain, and you will
                feel dizzy or faint.

                It is important to know, however, that there are a number of other potential causes for these
                symptoms—some as serious as heart irregularities, and others as innocuous as eating a large meal or
                using the bathroom (these latter examples are more common with frail older adults). Another important
                potential cause is medication—some medications, including water pills (diuretics), certain blood
                pressure pills, some drugs for psychiatric disorders, and medications for shrinking an enlarged prostate
                gland, can affect the blood vessels and heart such that they will not adjust properly to provide
                adequate blood pressure and blood flow to the brain. If you are experiencing this type of dizziness, and
                are on medication, talk to your doctor and make sure that your symptoms are not a side effect. If they
                are, your doctor may adjust or change your medication.
            </p>

                Seek immediate medical evaluation when you begin to get dizzy or faint. If internal hemorrhage,
                dehydration, or heart irregularities are causing your symptoms, emergency therapy could save your life.
                If the cause is less serious, and it relates to diet, eating small meals more frequently may help.
                Regardless, it is important to resolve this situation; dizziness is particularly dangerous in senior
                citizens, who are more subject to serious injuries when they fall.
