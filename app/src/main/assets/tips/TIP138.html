            A bulge of tissue often located in the groin area or around the belly button may be a hernia. Hernias are potentially dangerous and usually warrant repair.

                Hernias are most common at the belly button or in the groin.  A hernia occurs when a hole opens up in the muscles that constitute the belly wall or other muscular walls. Belly contents push through the hole, particularly when the pressure inside the belly cavity increases with activities such as lifting, straining, and coughing. The hole often gets larger over time, increasing the possibility of belly contents pushing through. If a segment of intestine pushes through the hole, it may become so kinked that it blocks the flow of the bowel’s contents. This kink could also cut off blood supply to the bowel, potentially leading to gangrene (death of part of the bowel). This condition can be fatal and warrants emergency surgical treatment.

                When a bulge is noted, it is important to determine if the contents inside the bulge can be pushed back in. As long as they can, no immediate danger exists, but you should still consult your doctor about possibly repairing the hernia. Don’t ignore a hernia because you think it’s small; it can still be very serious. Should the bulge become stuck, especially if it is tender and painful, urgent medical evaluation is needed.
