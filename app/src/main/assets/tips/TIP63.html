            If you develop a cough and/or shortness of breath after surgery—even a week or two afterward—you may have a
            blood clot in your lung, or pneumonia. You are particularly at risk if you first noticed swelling and
            tenderness in the back of your lower leg or in your groin, where a clot could have originated before
            traveling in the veins to your lung.

                During and after surgery, especially if your surgery was in the belly or pelvic area or on the bones and
                joints, you are at a high risk of developing blood clots in the veins of your pelvis and legs because
                the blood flow will slow down in these areas. If a fragment of the clot breaks off and flows up the
                bloodstream to the lungs, you may experience sudden shortness of breath, chest pain on taking a deep
                breath, and a cough. (See Tips 64, 81, 175, and 249.)

                It is important to notify your doctor immediately if you notice swelling and tenderness in your groin or
                leg at any time, including after surgery, even a week or two after you have gone home. Also, keep in
                mind that after surgery you are more susceptible to developing infections, such as pneumonia. (See Tip
                248.) Pneumonia can also cause shortness of breath, coughing, and a fever. In both cases you need
                emergency evaluation and therapy.
