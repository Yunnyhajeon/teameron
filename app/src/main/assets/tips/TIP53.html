            Any lump in the breast should be examined by a physician as soon as possible. If breast cancer is found and
            treated early, you have a greater chance for a cure.

                Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Many lumps are harmless growths or are tiny
                balloon-like structures containing fluid, called cysts. But any breast change should be evaluated
                without delay by a doctor to rule out cancer.

                Even though the mammogram (a special X-ray of the breast) is the best screening test to detect breast
                cancer, you can have a negative mammogram and still have breast cancer. Therefore your doctor should
                examine you first to try to locate a lump before ordering a mammogram. Alternatively, your doctor may
                choose to order a diagnostic test called an ultrasound, which uses special sound waves to take a picture
                of the lump. He or she may also insert a small needle to draw out any fluid or cells from the lump. For
                most women, examination of a piece of the lump (biopsy) under a microscope is the best way to make a
                definitive diagnosis of what is causing the abnormal growth.

                Risk factors for breast cancer include:
                <ul>
                    <li>a previous history of breast cancer</li>
                    <li>a family history of breast cancer (if your mother or sisters have had breast cancer, you are at
                        a two to three times greater risk)</li>
                    <li>increasing age (85 percent of breast cancers occur after the age of 40 and half of all breast
                        cancers occur in women over 65). Note: Younger women can also get breast cancer.</li>
                    <li>exposure to radiation</li>
                    <li>not having children</li>
                    <li>pregnancy at a late age (usually after 30)</li>
                    <li>early menstruation (before the age of 12)</li>
                    <li>going through menopause at a later age than normal (usually after 55)</li>
                    <li>long-term use of hormone replacement therapy with progesterone as a component</li>
                    <li>genetic predisposition (certain mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes)</li>
                    <li>the use of oral contraceptives</li>
                    <li>the regular consumption of alcohol</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>However, itâ€™s important to remember that the number 1 risk factor for breast cancer is being a
                    woman.</i> All women need to be conscientious about taking measures for early detection.
            </p>

                The key to beating breast cancer is early detection. Knowing what is normal for you may help you
                identify a lump, so many physicians feel that monthly breast self-exams are valuable. However, they
                should not take the place of routine breast exams by a physician and regular mammograms. A mammogram is
                the best test to pick up early breast cancer in the general population. (See Appendix B, page 364, for
                how to perform a breast self-exam and Appendix C, page 372, for information on breast cancer screening.)

                Contact your doctor immediately if you detect a lump in your breast. Only one percent of all breast
                cancers occur in men, but any man with a breast lump should also be examined by a physician.
