            Fever and continual drenching sweats at night suggest the presence of an infection such as tu- berculosis or an AIDS-related infection. Occasion- ally these symptoms occur with cancers, such as lymphomas and leukemia. There are also many other potential causes of night  sweats.

                Long-term infections are notorious for causing fever at night. When fever occurs, and your body’s temperature then returns to normal, drenching sweats result. They may be so profuse that you have to change your pajamas. This sweating is part of the body’s cooling mechanism, as it helps get rid of the heat of a high fever.

                A common cause of night sweats is tuberculosis (TB), a disease whose other symptoms include weight loss and a cough, sometimes with bloody phlegm. TB is more likely to occur in people with weak immune systems (such as those with AIDS), those traveling to countries with a high TB infection rate, and those who have been exposed to TB patients. Drug abusers, patients who have had their stomachs surgically removed, and those who have been exposed to silica (the major component of sand, used in making glass) are also prime candidates for TB.

                Night sweats are also one of the early signs of an HIV infection, the virus that causes AIDS, and they can occasionally be caused by cancers such as lymphoma. Other causes of night sweats include menopause, certain medications, low blood sugar, hormone disorders, and certain neurological conditions. Sometimes there is no identifiable cause.

                Persistent night sweats and fever are red light warning signals that you should see your doctor for medical evaluation as soon as possible.
