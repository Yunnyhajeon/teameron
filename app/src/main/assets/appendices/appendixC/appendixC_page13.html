                <p><b>Eyes</b></p>
Children younger than three years of age should have their eyes screened at each checkup with their primary care physician, using the red reflex test. Another important screening test is where the doctor alternately covers and uncovers each eye. These tests can identify serious eye problems that are treatable when caught early. Starting at three years of age, vision should be checked once a year using standard picture or letter optotypes. At any age: If one or both eyes constantly cross or the red reflex looks different between the eyes in photos, the child should have a complete eye exam by an ophthalmologist.
</p>
<p><b>Ears</b></p>
<p>
At ages four and five, hearing should be checked. For a hearing screening, an odeometer is used to play sounds at different frequencies. The child is usually asked to wear headphones and raise his/her hand on whichever side he or she hears a beep.
</p>
<p>
There are also a variety of tests you can do at home to monitor your child’s hearing. If the child is under two years old, you can test their “startle response” by slapping your hand on a table when they aren’t looking. Watch to see if they jump at the noise. If the child is between two and four years old, turn on one of their toys that makes noise and keep it hidden from their view. Watch to see if they look in that direction. If the child is between four and six years old, monitor whether the child responds when asked questions.

<p><b>Dental Exams</b></p>
The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends taking your child for his or her first dental checkup when his/ her first tooth appears or when he or she turns one year old. The dentist will examine the child’s mouth to make sure the gums and teeth are healthy, as well as give the parents guidance about helping the child develop good dental hygiene habits. This initial visit also begins to familiarize the child with being in the dental chair. Speak to the dentist about appropriate follow-up visits.

<p><b>Scoliosis</b></p>
Around the age of puberty (eleven to thirteen), all children should be screened for scoliosis. This involves having the child stand in different positions and postures to measure the curvature of the spine. Most schools now provide scoliosis screenings for all students around the age of puberty.

<p><b>Immunizations</b></p>
