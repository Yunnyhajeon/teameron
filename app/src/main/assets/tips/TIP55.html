            There are many types of fluids that can drain abnormally from your nipple. The following are the three main types: bloody discharge, white milky fluid, and green fluid. The type of fluid is indicative of the underlying breast problem. Clear fluids should also be evaluated by your physician because they are occasionally a sign of breast cancer.

<b>Bloody discharge.</b> A bloody discharge from the nipple that is sometimes watery and foul-smelling could be a serious matter. Most often, it originates from a localized growth (intraductal papilloma) in the lining of the tiny tube leading to the nipple of the breast. These tiny growths are so small that they cannot be felt by examining the breast. Although uncommon, intraductal cancer must be considered. A mammogram, biopsy, and/or surgical exploration of the nipple duct may be needed to rule out cancer. See your doctor as soon as possible.

<b>White milky fluid.</b> A milky white substance leaking from one or both of your nipples is called galactorrhea. Gently milk your nipple to see if you can draw out the fluid. Note the color, amount, and consistency. The fluid of galactorrhea has the consistency of water. The amount is usually small and is similar to the fluid secreted during pregnancy.

                The pituitary gland, which is attached to the undersurface of the brain, secretes prolactin, the hormone responsible for lactation. Certain benign (noncancerous) tumors of this gland over-secrete the substance, causing the breast to leak this white watery discharge. Other signs that this might be occurring include the absence or alteration of your menstrual periods and problems with your peripheral vision (such as experiencing narrowed vision, like a horse wearing blinders). Tumors of this type are benign, but if untreated they can cause damage to surrounding brain structures, like the nerves to the eye.

                Other possible causes for nipple discharge include certain medications, foreplay with the nipples, jogging without proper breast support, or various ailments including hypothyroidism (a low-functioning thyroid gland) or shingles (a painful rash caused by a virus). See your doctor for appropriate evaluation.

<b>Green fluid.</b> A green-colored, watery fluid coming from the nipple of one or both breasts is fairly common and usually benign, although it may persist. It often comes from small fluidfilled pockets in the breast, which are caused by hormones. The fluid is usually first noticed when you discover a stain on your bra. You can make sure it is coming from the nipple by compressing your breast. If a drop of fluid appears on the nippleâ€™s surface, dab it with a tissue to note the color. Your breasts may also be tender; this discharge usually occurs around the time of menstruation, which is the time of maximum breast engorgement. See your doctor for evaluation.
