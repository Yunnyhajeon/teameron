            If you get an irregular pulse after youâ€™ve experienced excessive fluid loss from diarrhea, water pills, and/or sweating, that irregular pulse may be the result of changes in the mineral levels of your blood, such as the level of potassium. This may have serious health consequences. The red light warning signals may include: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, heart pounding, and muscle cramps in the leg.

<p>
                If you have lost an excessive amount of fluid from any cause, including sweating, taking water pills, or having prolonged or severe diarrhea, you may lose large quantities of certain minerals such as potassium.  The loss of potassium can result in abnormal electrical charges in your heart, causing dangerous irregular heartbeats. This can be life-threatening; emergency medical therapy and monitoring by a physician is necessary. Often special intravenous fluids are needed to replace these minerals.

                On the other hand, heart rhythm problems can also occur if there is an excess of potassium or certain other minerals in the blood. If you experience these symptoms, you need to be taken to an emergency room immediately.
