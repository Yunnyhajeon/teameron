            Red light warning signals of a rare but serious infection called toxic shock syndrome are lower belly pain and a high fever, often with a bright red rash  spreading  from  mid-body  to  all  over the body, and a “strawberry”-appearing tongue. Any severe vaginal infection (sometimes associated with the use of tampons) may lead to this ailment.

                First observed in young menstruating women, toxic shock syndrome is a rare but potentially fatal ailment. The onset of the infection is sudden and it rapidly progresses from a high fever and diarrhea with lower belly pain to a dramatic drop in blood pressure and death.

                This disease is more common in women who use tampons, especially when they leave them in for longer than normal periods of time. (It is recommended that tampons be changed every four to eight hours and not be used continuously throughout the menstrual cycle.) Improper use may contribute to the development of the infection, which is caused by a rare strain of commonly occurring bacteria. Severe vaginal infections may be a clue that this ailment is present.

                If treatment with antibiotics begins early, you can fully recover. If you have a high fever, lower belly pain, and a vaginal infection, you should go to an emergency room.
