            An early sign of a potentially serious infection of the female organs is a foul-smelling, thick, greenish discharge from the vagina, often accompanied by lower belly discomfort.

<p>
                A discharge like this and/or severe lower belly pain that is tender to the touch, is often the first sign of a serious infection in the female organs. This infection can spread into your womb (uterus) and fallopian tubes, causing a condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and it can then also spread into your belly cavity.
            </p>
<p>
                Irritation of the vagina may be the only other symptom of PID. Alternatively, you may also have a fever of 101 degrees or higher, with weakness, nausea, vomiting, and generalized aching. As this condition progresses, pelvic pus pockets can form, and the infection can spread throughout the body. Scarring may occur in the area around the womb, which can impair fertility or even cause sterility. The scarring increases the risk of having a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes, which can burst, causing a life-threatening internal hemorrhage. (See Tip 192.) 
            </p>
<p>
                Early medical evaluation and treatment of PID manifesting itself with a vaginal discharge (especially with lower belly discomfort) can prevent the dangerous spread of the infection.
