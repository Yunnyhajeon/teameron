            Mild or severe upper-middle or left belly pain extending into the back with nausea and/or vomiting may be caused by pancreatitis. The pain is often less severe when sitting up and bending forward, while it worsens when lying flat on your back. Severe cases can cause diabetes, release dangerous chemicals into the blood, and produce internal hemorrhaging. Consumption of alcohol and foods high in fat content can cause this condition or make it much worse.
