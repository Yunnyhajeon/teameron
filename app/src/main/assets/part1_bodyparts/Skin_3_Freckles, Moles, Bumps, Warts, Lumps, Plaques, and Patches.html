            Irregular-shaped, dark, multicolored, enlarging, bleeding, itching, or painful moles need to be frequently checked for early detection of malignant melanoma. Early treatment can be life-saving. Being seen within days or a couple of weeks is much better than within months. The sooner, the better.

                Moles that can turn into cancer (malignant melanoma) may be raised, like regular moles, or flush with the skin surface, like large, dark freckles. They often begin as an abnormal growth of pigment cells, which then darken with exposure to the sun. Pigmented lesions on the pads of the hands and soles of the feet (more commonly seen in African Americans), and dark streaks under the fingernails or toenails can also be signs of melanoma. There is even a rare type of melanoma that has no pigment.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have a mole or moles with any of the following features (which suggest they are cancerous), see your doctor or a dermatologist right away:
                <ul>
                    <li>Asymmetrical shapeâ€”not a smooth, round circle, like a regular mole</li>
                    <li>Multicolored appearance with shades of brown, black, gray, red, and white</li>
                    <li>Large size (greater than the eraser end of a pencil)</li>
                    <li>Growth in size over a period of time (unlike regular moles, which do not grow)</li>
                    <li>Itching, pain, or bleeding</li>
                    <li>Any kind of change in a mole</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The incidence of malignant melanomas is increasing in the population at large. They are most prevalent in adults over thirty years of age and are actually the most common cancer in people who are between twenty-five and thirty-five. The following increase your risk of developing this cancer:
                <ul>
                    <li>You have been diagnosed by a physician as having certain types of moles that are precancerous.</li>
                    <li>Members of your family have had a malignant melanoma.</li>
                    <li>You are light-skinned and easily sunburned.</li>
                    <li>You have been exposed to a great deal of sunlight, especially in childhood and adolescence, and have had multiple sunburns in the past.</li>
                    <li>You have many moles of any kind.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Monitor your moles on a regular basis, including those in the genital area, where changes are often missed (the use of a mirror may be helpful). Avoid tanning beds. If you are at a high risk of developing a malignant melanoma, your dermatologist or primary care doctor should assist you in monitoring your moles. If you detect a suspicious mole, see your doctor or dermatologist as soon as possible so that it can be removed early and examined under a microscope. A simple removal of the mole is all that is necessary if it is less than .75 millimeters and without special features as seen under the microscope by a pathologist. If there is a need for further surgery, consider getting a thorough evaluation by someone who specializes in melanoma treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Try to preempt this problem by using sun protection routinely after six months of age. The UVB sun protection factor should be SPF 30 or greater, and the container should indicate that both UVB and UVA light are blocked. (Also see Appendix C, for routine screening information.)

            A pearly bump on the face or other area of the skin exposed to the sun is a potential sign of skin cancer. Early treatment is important.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                If you have spent lots of time in the sun, and have developed a round, pearly bump on your face, you may have a skin cancer known as basal cell carcinoma. The face, like other areas of the skin exposed to sunlight, is a common site for this type of tumor. Basal cell cancers are usually slow-growing and do not spread, but there are exceptions. Basal cell carcinomas are most often diagnosed in people forty years of age and older. However, they can also be found in people as young as in their twenties. Albinos are particularly at risk of getting this skin condition.
            </p>

            <p>
                A diagnosis is made when your doctor cuts off a slice of the bump and inspects it under a microscope. Surgical removal can usually cure this condition. If you suspect you may have skin cancer, do not wait. See your physician early.

            Freckles on the lips, in the mouth, or on the inside of the lips are associated with growths in the intestines, which can become cancerous (Peutz-Jeghers syndrome).
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                In the unusual, inherited condition called Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, freckles occur on the lips and on the inside of the mouth. They may be present at birth, develop over time, or even disappear over time. It is important to determine whether they are associated with dangerous polyps (growths) in the intestines.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have freckles that follow this pattern, an evaluation by a doctor may be appropriate to find and remove any polyps. This may help you to avoid intestinal bleeding and to prevent cancerous growths. Sometimes the polyps may already be malignant, in which case early surgical removal can be curative.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let your doctor know if you have this warning signal, especially if you have a family member who has had cancer of the colon. (See Tip 226 for more information on this disorder in children.)

            A flat deposit or plaque that is yellowish to white in color may appear in the skin above or under an eye, at the side of the nose, or in another area on your body, such as under the elbow. It can be the sign of a serious cholesterol problem.
        </div>

        <div class="body_contents">
            <p>
                The deposit or plaque will usually be oblong in shape rather than round like a cyst, and will be about a quarter of an inch wide. If you have one of these, it will usually not cause you any discomfort. The plaque is inside of your skin, though, so you will not be able to remove it by squeezing out its contents.
            </p>

            <p>
                The plaque is probably a fatty deposit, and as such, it may be a warning sign that you have a dangerously high blood cholesterol and/or triglyceride level. The cholesterol can invade the wall of an artery, eventually resulting in total blockage of the vital blood vessels that provide nourishment to the heart or brain, causing a heart attack or stroke.
            </p>

            <p>
                These yellow, cheesy-looking plaques are a warning message that you should heed. See your doctor and have your blood checked for cholesterol and other fats. Plaques can be removed for cosmetic reasons, but they may recur, unless the underlying problems are resolved. Most importantly, high cholesterol and other fat levels in the blood should be lowered with diet and/or medicines. (See Tip 174 for more information on an elevated cholesterol level, especially in senior citizens. Also see Appendix C, for information on cholesterol screenings.)
