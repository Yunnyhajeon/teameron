            Cramping belly pain with a swollen belly, vomiting, and no bowel movement or passage of gas for more than twenty-four hours may mean that you have a life-threatening bowel blockage.

<p>
                The bowel can be blocked either in the small intestine or in the large intestine. When it is blocked, fecal material and gas will back up. As the bowel attempts to force material through the blockage, you will experience severe cramping belly pain. If the location of the blockage is high up in the small bowel, vomiting will occur early on. If the blockage is low in the colon, vomiting will occur late or not at all.

                Prior abdominal surgery is the most frequent cause of bowel obstruction. Scar tissue or adhesions occur after such surgery. Often these adhesions are “bandlike,” stretching from one organ to another. These “bands” may cause entrapment of a loop of the bowel, kinking it sufficiently to block it. When left untreated, the entanglement may cut off blood circulation to the bowel wall, causing gangrene of the loop of bowel that is entrapped. If the blockage is not relieved by surgery, death can occur.
            </p>

                Colon blockage can also be caused by cancerous growths, severe inflammation and infection of the colon, and from thick, solid, hard stools accumulating in the rectum (an impaction). Impactions are commonly treated with enemas, but if this proves unsuccessful, blockages can often be removed by a health professional sticking a gloved finger up the rectum and carefully removing the hardened stools. This condition is more common in senior citizens or dehydrated bedridden patients.

                If you are experiencing the symptoms of bowel obstruction, you should seek immediate medical attention.
