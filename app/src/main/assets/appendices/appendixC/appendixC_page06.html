                Following a routine screening schedule could save your life. Early detection, before you have any warning signs, can improve your chances of being cured of the cancer. This disease is not rare!

<p><b>Screening for Kidney Disease</b></p>
A simple urine dipstick (a strip of paper that turns different colors depending on the contents of the urine) is dipped in a urine sample to detect early kidney disease, particularly in diabetics. A positive result can indicate that you need to go on medication to prevent diabetes-related kidney failure.

                <p><b>Pap Smear/Pelvic Exam</b></p>
                       <p>
It is important to see a physician (a gynecologist, family physician, or internist) for a thorough pelvic examination on a regular basis in case changes suggestive of cancer occur. The Pap smear is the test used to check for abnormalities of the cervix (the lower opening of the uterus, or womb). It should first be performed the same year that a woman begins to have vaginal intercourse, but no later then when she turns twentyone years of age. After the initial screening, she should get a Pap smear done every year with the regular Pap test and a pelvic exam.</p>
<p>

There is now a vaccine for HPV (human papilloma virus), which many medical groups recommend, in general, for females between eleven and twenty-six years of age. However, there are other considerations that should be discussed with the doctor. Also, all women should continue to be screened for cervical cancer regardless of whether they get the HPV vaccination.
