            Severe back and, in certain cases, leg pain, especially when accompanied by a fever, may mean you have a serious infection rather than a backbone problem such as a disk herniation or spur. If the pain is caused by an infection, often the lower back will be tender to the touch. Senior citizens and/or debilitated people are more vulnerable to these massive infections.

                At first the symptoms may seem mild: some redness around a cut on your leg (which only appears to be a minor infection), pain during urination, and/or a chest cold that just seems to get worse. Afterward you develop a major symptom: an overwhelming and agonizingly severe pain in your lower back and legs. The pain is so severe that you don’t mention your earlier symptoms when you visit your doctor—they seem so minor in comparison. The doctor can easily assume your back pain is being caused by a run-of-the-mill muscle strain or lumbar disk disease and may make the wrong diagnosis. This error could have dire consequences.

                Though it happens rarely, minor infections can spread rapidly through the bloodstream to locations throughout the body. Fever and severe back pain, frequently accompanied by leg pain, may be the signal that this has happened. Sometimes if a massive infection has overwhelmed the body’s defense mechanism, there will be no fever. It is crucial that the victim is immediately treated by a doctor, with life-saving intravenous antibiotics.

                An important message here is that you should always carefully report all of your symptoms to the doctor, even if they seem minor.

                Note: Sometimes a minor infection will not spread throughout the body but will advance into a serious pocket of pus, called an abscess, which often needs to be drained by a surgeon. (For an example of this, see Tip 119.)
