            A cough, fever, and chest pains with or without other common cold symptoms are often indicators of pneumonia. Failure to improve after fortyeight hours of treatment for pneumonia is a strong indication of a more serious infection requiring immediate medical evaluation. Note: These symptoms are sometimes indicators of blood clots in the lungs (see Tips 62 to 64, 175, and 249).
