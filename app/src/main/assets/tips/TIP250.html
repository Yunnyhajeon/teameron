                If you have coronary heart disease and need surgery, taking the medication referred to as a “betablocker” before, during, and after your operation may reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications from the  surgery.

<p>
                    This tip applies to surgery performed anywhere on a person with coronary heart disease, not just operations on the heart or blood vessels.

                    There are a few contraindications concerning the use of these medications, especially for patients with certain heart or lung conditions, but the majority of patients who need them are able to take them. Mention beta-blockers to your surgeon just to make sure that the possibility of using them has not been overlooked. Multiple assistants may be involved in your care, and somebody on the team may have forgotten to prescribe this medication.
