                In certain surgical cases, taking the right antibiotic within one hour before your skin is surgically cut will reduce your likelihood of getting an infection.

                This very important discovery was made by investigators reviewing two million cases in the Veterans Administration Healthcare System. It is so important that it has become the standard of care in all American hospitals. Make sure that the proper antibiotic is given if you are having one of certain surgical procedures performed, including:
                <ul>
<li>Blood vessel surgery</li>
<li>Colon/large intestine surgery</li>
<li>Hip joint replacement surgery</li>
<li>Hysterectomy</li>
<li>Knee joint replacement surgery</li>
</ul>
<p>
                    The proper use of preoperative antibiotics involves two steps. Number one: selecting the appropriate antibiotic for the anticipated surgical procedure, taking into account the patientâ€™s history of medication allergies. Number two: making absolutely sure that it is given within one hour of the actual surgical incision. Sometimes the antibiotic is given in the operating room. If it is given too early or after the skin is cut, its effectiveness is lost.
                </p>
<p>
                    This seems simple enough. You would expect it to happen 100 percent of the time or at least nearly 100 percent. Not so. The compliance to this required safety measure is often as low as 60 percent in some hospitals.
                </p>
<p>
                    Discuss the use of antibiotics with your surgeon before you go to the hospital, and consider insisting that the surgery not be performed without it. If it comes time to cut and the appropriate prophylactic antibiotic has not been given to you an hour earlier, it may be necessary to reschedule the surgery, unless delaying it could cause serious health problems.
                </p>
<p>
                    This preemptive step of using a prophylactic antibiotic can prevent devastating infections that could cause prolonged hospitalization, deformities, disfigurations, and even death. It is a giant step forward in patient safety.
