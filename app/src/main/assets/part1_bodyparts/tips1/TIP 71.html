            A persistent cough lasting more than two weeks may be caused by something as simple as bronchitis or allergies, or by something as serious as tuberculosis, pneumonia, heart disease, or cancer. An annoying chronic cough can also be caused by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus (the tube between the mouth and the stomach). You should be evaluated as soon as possible, especially if you cough up blood, which may then get into the lungs.
