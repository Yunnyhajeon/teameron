            Deformities of the chest can impair breathing. They may worsen over time, so itâ€™s important that they are treated early.

                Deformities of the chest are common birth defects that can affect the ability of the lungs to expand adequately. The chest wall is distorted, chest volume is reduced, and the heart may be displaced, encroaching on the lungs. There are three kinds of chest deformities that can interfere with breathing. Pectus excavatum is a sunken breastbone, scoliosis is a curved spine, and kyphoscoliosis is a hunchback condition with a curved spine. Of these, kyphoscoliosis is the common chest deformity that causes the most breathing problems.

                If you have one of these conditions, then recurrent vertebral fractures, arthritis of the joints where the ribs connect to the sternum, and obesity would all pose special challenges for you. By further limiting the ability of your chest wall to expand, these factors would cause you to have more serious breathing difficulties. As you get older, the muscles of your thorax may become weaker and impair your ability to breathe. Indeed, with time, even a mild curvature of the spine may get worse and result in significant distortion of the chest. And an additional risk posed by all of these ailments is that they decrease the ability to cough up accumulated secretions and limit oxygen intake, thus increasing your chances for developing pneumonia.

                If you have a chest deformity, have your lung function checked periodically by a physician. If you develop congestion, have it checked and treated right away. Note: It is very dangerous to create more problems for your lungs by smoking.
