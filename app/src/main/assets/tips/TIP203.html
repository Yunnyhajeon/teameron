            If you suspect that your child or adolescent is depressed, immediately seek appropriate help. Suicide is one of the most common causes of death among teenagers.

                Depression can happen in even the most loving of homes.  Whether or not it is precipitated by a personal crisis, it is usually caused by a chemical imbalance and/or a family predisposition. Children and teenagers with depression are often labeled “difficult” or “moody” rather than given appropriate help. The stigma of depression can also cause people to avoid seeking help—a delay that can have tragic results.

                Clinical depression is a prolonged, persistent disturbance of mood, often with associated physical symptoms. The warning signs may include:
                <ul>
<li>Persistent sadness and complaints, with a negative self image</li>
<li>Lack of interest in favorite activities and food</li>
<li>Withdrawal from family and friends (at times with hostility)</li>
<li>Worsening school performance</li>
<li>Anxiety about simple tasks and events</li>
<li>Sleep disturbances, either insomnia or hypersomnia (long periods of sleep)</li>
<li>Appetite changes: loss of appetite or overeating</li>
<li>Multiple physical complaints: aches and pains everywhere</li>
<li>Hinting at suicide or giving away prized possessions</li>
<li>Irritability</li>
<li>Apparent personality change in a teenager/extreme teenage rebelliousness</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                There is a greater risk that your depressed child might commit suicide if the following risk factors apply to him/her:
                <ul>
<li>Male sex (although more girls attempt suicide, more boys actually succeed)</li>
<li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
<li>A gun in the house (firearms are used the most to commit suicide in America)</li>
<li>A previous suicide attempt</li>
<li>A recent suicide in your area</li>
<li>A bereavement experience: a death, a divorce, a failed exam, rejection by friends, and the like</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                If your child exhibits symptoms of depression and/or is at risk of committing suicide, get them assessed and treated before they can injure themselves seriously. With counseling and medication (if appropriate), he or she can go on to live a full and normal life. (See Tip 12 for more on depression).
