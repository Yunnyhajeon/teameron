            An electrical abnormality of the heart known as long QT syndrome can cause sudden death, especially in young adults, and even  in  children. The red light warning signals may include unexplained seizures or sudden loss of consciousness, often during physical activity such as swimming, when emotionally upset, or when startled by a noise. Itâ€™s also reported that people with long QT syndrome may experience an irregular heartbeat with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness, sudden spells of dizziness, and/or heart pounding. However, it must be emphasized that these symptoms are very rarely associated with long QT syndrome and are usually related to other medical conditions.
