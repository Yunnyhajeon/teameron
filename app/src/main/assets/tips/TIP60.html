            Excessive snoring, short episodes of “no breathing” during sleep, and/or daytime sleepiness may indicate
            that your oxygen supply is being cut off at night. This can result in serious health problems.

                If you suffer from unexplained excessive daytime sleepiness (falling asleep at stoplights or while
                watching television) and are told that you snore loudly or intermittently stop breathing when you sleep,
                then you may have a medical condition known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is more often seen in
                African Americans and obese adults with short, thick necks, small chins, and floppy airways. During
                sleep, part of the soft palate (the back of the roof of the mouth), the tonsils, or the base of the
                tongue is flip-flopping over your airway, causing you to snore and intermittently stop breathing for a
                few seconds. You may wake up without knowing why. The impact of intermittently cutting off the oxygen
                supply to the body has serious consequences—high blood pressure and permanent damage to the brain,
                heart, and lungs.

                The diagnosis of OSA can be made by special tests ordered by your physician. Treatment often includes
                the use of a breathing assist device, called a C-PAP, while sleeping. The C-PAP pushes air through a
                mask you wear to keep your airway open. In some selected cases surgery or special oral appliances may
                also be indicated to correct the problem.

                There are many simple things you can do to help ease your condition and minimize its negative side
                effects. Go on a diet if you are overweight. Since alcoholic beverages and sedative medications can
                worsen your condition, avoid them. Taking medications to treat insomnia when you have obstructive sleep
                apnea can actually be life-threatening. And, since OSA puts you in danger of falling asleep behind the
                wheel, don’t drive until the problem is corrected.

            <p>
                This condition is an emergency if you stop breathing more than once every two minutes or you stop
                breathing for more than one minute at a time. The sooner you are evaluated and treated, the less the
                risk of serious complications.
