            If you listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear a swooshing sound, it may indicate a heart murmur. You should seek medical evaluation by your doctor.

                A heart murmur is a swooshing sound coming from within the heart. Heart murmurs are quite common and frequently do not indicate a serious problem. For example, they may be the result of blood passing rapidly but normally through one of the four valves (doors) in the heart (see Figure 9). A large percentage of adolescents have murmurs that are not caused by disease. But a murmur may be abnormal when a damaged valve in the heart contributes to making the sound. It may also occur when blood travels through an abnormal hole in a wall that separates two heart chambers.

                To understand why blood passing through a narrowed opening makes this sound, think about a garden hose. A garden hose makes little noise when water flows from it, but if you put a nozzle on the end, a swooshing noise is created as the water spews through the narrow opening. The same thing happens with the heart when blood flows through an abnormally narrow opening or rapidly through a normal opening. While listening to the heart with a stethoscope, the loudness, location, timing, and pitch of the murmur help the doctor to determine if and where the heart is damaged.

                Certain heart murmurs must be monitored by your doctor to determine if the problem is worsening and if and when the abnormality should be corrected so that permanent damage can be avoided. For example, one common cause of a heart murmur is a ventricular septal defect, a birth defect in which there is an opening in the wall that separates the lower chambers of the heart. This opening causes an abnormal flow of blood, which can permanently damage the lungs. Diagnosis and treatment are essential. There are many other situations in which a murmur requires regular monitoring or medical intervention.

                Both a damaged valve that has been infected in the past and an artificial valve provide prime targets for bacterial growth (bacterial endocarditis). Therefore, if you have these or certain other heart conditions and you are undergoing a procedure anywhere else on your body, it may be very important for you to take an antibiotic. For example, small amounts of bacteria can get in your blood during dental work or when tubes are put in your body to examine your bladder or colon. These bacteria may then grow on an abnormal heart valve or on an artificial valve in your heart. Appropriate antibiotics will kill any germs that get into your blood before they do damage.
