            Carbon monoxide gas is odorless and tasteless, and inhaling it can be fatal. If your child is in an enclosed area and starts developing headaches, possibly with nausea and vomiting, and especially if others in the area begin experiencing similar symptoms, it may be due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Symptoms are often subtle and may include weakness and/or drowsiness, which can cause one to fall asleep rather than evacuating the contaminated area. A more distinctive sign is that your lips and gums may turn cherry red. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, you must evacuate the area and seek urgent medical treatment. Children and pets will usually be affected first.
