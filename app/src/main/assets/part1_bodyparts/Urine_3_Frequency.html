            If you are having difficulty passing urine or cannot urinate at all, you need urgent relief. It is very important to determine the cause, which can be life-saving. Permanent correction is necessary to avoid kidney failure.

                The inability to urinate requires urgent treatment. If you are not able to urinate, try sitting in a tub of warm water three to four inches deep. After a few minutes, try to urinate in the water. Though it is a more extreme solution, your discomfort can also be relieved by your being catheterized (having a tube placed into the bladder, usually by a doctor or a nurse). In situations when you can only partially empty your bladder, urine remains and accumulates there, which is a prime setup for infection. If left untreated, this type of infection can spread into the kidneys and destroy them.
            </p>

            <p>
                What causes this problem of not being able to urinate? In men, an enlarged prostate gland may be blocking the flow of urine from the bladder, since the tube to the outside runs through the prostate. In both women and men, the urethra, the tube leading from the bladder to the outside of the body, may be narrowed by irritation and/or scars from an infection. Another cause of difficulty urinating may be the loss of strength in the muscles in the wall of the bladder, such that they are no longer strong enough to force urine through the urethra (the outflow passage). Diseases such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis can damage the nerves responsible for squeezing the bladder, while antihistamines and certain other over-the-counter medicines can constrict or partially close the bladder opening. This situation is self-perpetuating, as the longer the inability to urinate exists, the more the bladder wall expands, making it thinner and weaker, and this weakened wall is less able to squeeze urine out of the bladder.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the passageway from the bladder to the outside of the body is blocked, effective treatment may include medication or a procedure to permanently unblock it. In men with an enlarged prostate, a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test, an ultrasound, and/or a biopsy of the prostate tissue will help to determine if the enlargement is due to cancer. Early detection and treatment of cancer can be life-saving.
            </p>

            <p>
                In conclusion, when you have difficulty urinating, see your doctor immediately or go to an emergency room for urgent relief. You need timely follow-up by a urologist (surgical kidney specialist) to evaluate and treat the underlying problem.

            Increased urination, weight loss, blurred distance vision, and/or increased thirst and appetite are highly suggestive of diabetes. The early stages of diabetes often have no symptoms, and the only way to know if you have it is to have your fasting blood sugar checked.
        </div>

                Weight loss is a sign of many disorders. But when you experience it along with an increased appetite and continuous thirst, you may have a certain type of diabetes. This condition also causes frequent urination, and may cause blurring of your distance vision.
            </p>

            <p>
                Type 1 diabetes occurs when cells in the pancreas stop secreting insulin, the hormone responsible for transporting sugar in the blood to your body cells. Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, is caused by a combination of insufficient insulin plus resistance to the action of insulin. When sugar increases in the blood, it will pass into the urine, pulling extra fluid along with it. You will drink more to replenish your fluids, and will continue to urinate a lot. The resulting changes in fluid and sugar levels often cause fluctuating blurry vision. The loss of sugar and water in your urine results in lost calories, dehydration, and hence weight loss. Due to the lack of insulin, the body cannot use the sugar as a source of energy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Diabetes can be diagnosed by obtaining a fasting blood sugar test, which means you do not eat for at least eight hours before the test. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dl or higher suggests a diagnosis of diabetes. (See more about diabetes screenings in Appendix C, page 383.)
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have diabetes, it is important to keep track of your blood sugar levels. You can use a glucometer with a test strip (available at pharmacies) to check the sugar in your blood. Also, your doctor can obtain a very helpful blood test, called hemoglobin A1c, to get an average assessment of your blood sugar level over a period of three months. This test is particularly valuable because the complications of diabetes are closely related to the long-term continuous control of blood sugar levels. Diagnosing this disease early is important so that treatment can be instituted to prevent complications. These include kidney disease, blindness, heart ailments, skin problems, and damage to blood vessels. Diabetes may also lead to the loss of toes, feet, or legs as a result of the buildup of fat deposits in the blood vessels, which blocks the supply of nourishment and oxygen to these specific areas of the body.
            </p>

            <p>
                Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin injections. A balanced diet with limited carbohydrates and minimal sugar intake is recommended. In addition, you should follow a healthy exercise program tailored to your needs.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the case of type 2 diabetes, weight loss and exercise improve insulin action and are helpful. A special diet is also important, and sometimes medications are needed to control blood sugar levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you experience increased urination, appetite, and thirst, often with weight loss, seek medical evaluation to determine if you have diabetes or if there is another cause for these symptoms.
