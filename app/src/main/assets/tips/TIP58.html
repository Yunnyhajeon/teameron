            Wheezing means you potentially have a serious lung problem.

                Wheezing is the noise produced by air as it is forced through narrowed air passages in the lungs when
                you breathe out. Narrowing of the air passages may suddenly occur due to a squeezing of the muscles
                (bronchospasm) in the wall of the small airways. This produces asthma, which may be the result of an
                inflammatory or allergic reaction, an inhaled irritant, or a reaction to medicines, infection, stress,
                and/or inhaling cold air. (See Tips 169 to 171 on allergies.)

                Asthma attacks can be severe and life-threatening. Even if your wheezing is only mild, you could someday
                have an attack so severe that you would not be able to breathe. Therefore, if you wheeze, you should be
                evaluated for asthma. The treatment includes sprays and pills that can relax the muscles in the walls of
                the airways. (See Tips 57, 211, and 212 on asthma.)

                Emphysema can also cause wheezing by destroying lung tissue, which results in narrowed air passages in
                the lungs. In emphysema there are also pockets of dead air space in the lungs, due to the disease’s
                destruction of the lungs’ tiny air sacs, called alveoli. This stale air takes up space in the lungs,
                limiting the amount of fresh air you can breathe in, and ultimately prevents you from getting enough
                oxygen in your blood. If the disease progresses, it can be fatal (see Tip 66 for more information on
                emphysema).

                Alternatively, tumors in the lung and heart failure are both conditions that can block air passages and
                cause wheezing.
