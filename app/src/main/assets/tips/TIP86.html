            The onset of a rapid pulse, especially if it starts and stops suddenly and occurs intermittently, may appear with the following symptoms: heart palpitations, fluttering, pounding or skipped beats, sudden spells of weakness and/or dizziness, and/or loss of consciousness. A sudden rapid pulse is most likely caused by an abnormality in the electrical system of the heart.

<p>
                When your heart suddenly starts beating too fast because of a heart rhythm abnormality, its rate will usually be over 120 and can even be as high as 160 to 200. This rapidity can interfere with the pumping action of the heart, so that blood flow is compromised. You may experience symptoms of weakness, dizziness, light-headedness, and, if severe enough, sudden loss of consciousness. If you experience any of these symptoms, have someone take you to an emergency room. Make sure you stop consuming all caffeine, street drugs, herbal products (including teas), and over-the-counter medications until you discuss your condition with a doctor. Also tell the doctor you had been taking these products. If you pass out even for a short time, and/or experience chest pain or shortness of breath, call 911.

                Sudden changes in your heart rhythm and a rapid or irregular pulse can be dangerous, particularly if you have previously experienced a heart ailment such as a heart attack, heart failure, or heart enlargement from high blood pressure.
