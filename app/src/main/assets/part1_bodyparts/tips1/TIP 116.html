            Yeast infections cause a red sore on the skin with a buttermilk or cottage cheeseâ€“type discharge from the vagina. These infections can also appear as white patches in the mouth. Repeated yeast infections in the vagina, on the skin, or in the corners of the mouth may be a warning sign of diabetes or AIDS, so if you have repeated yeast infections, see your doctor as soon as possible.
