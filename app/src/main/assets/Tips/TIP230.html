            There is an inherited disorder that is associated with the following signs: sparse hair, fragile nails, dry skin, and abnormal development of teeth (pointed teeth, missing teeth, etc.). This disorder is also associated with a condition whereby the body is unable to maintain the correct temperature. A child with this condition is in danger of dying from extreme heat within his/her body (i.e. an extremely high temperature).

                Several conditions, collectively called ectodermal dysplasias, involve the above abnormalities.

            </p>

                Since the ability to sweat may be impaired, the child may be unable to regulate his or her temperature and become dangerously hot (hyperthermic). Even a mild illness may cause extremely high fevers. You must take specific measures to keep your child from overheating. Children with these conditions are also more susceptible to getting nasal and lung infections.

            </p>

                A child with the above symptoms should be assessed by a skin specialist (dermatologist) as soon as possible.
