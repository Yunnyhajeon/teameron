            Any woman who notices persistent and/or unexplained bloating, abdominal discomfort or pain, and/or feeling full more quickly should be evaluated by a physician. While these symptoms have many common causes that are not serious, they could also be the first symptoms of life-threatening conditions such as ovarian or other types of cancer. Identifying the source early can improve the odds of successful treatment.

<p>
                Bloating, pressure, and/or discomfort or pain in the abdomen are possible symptoms of ovarian cancer. Others include feeling full more quickly than normal, having trouble eating, and having to urinate often and/or urgently. These relatively common symptoms are often caused by less serious conditions such as urinary tract infections or irritable bowel syndrome. The symptoms may even be caused by totally innocuous conditionsâ€”like the bloating regularly experienced around menstruation or the discomfort caused by an overactive bladder. However, you may want to see a gynecologist to rule out ovarian cancer if these problems are new, severe, and occur continuously for several weeks.

                Any woman who has reached sexual maturity should begin to see her family physician or gynecologist on a regular basis to be screened for ovarian cancer. It should be part of her routine health maintenance. During a pelvic exam, the doctor will check the size and shape of the ovaries. However, ovarian tumors are difficult to identify early because the ovaries are situated deep within the body. If you have a high risk of this type of cancer, your doctor will likely suggest additional testing.

                Risk factors for ovarian cancer include:
                <ul>
<li>A strong family history of ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer</li>
<li>Increasing age (usually after menopause)</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Starting menstruation early (before twelve years of age)</li>
<li>Having no children or having the first child after the age of thirty</li>
<li>Going through menopause late (mid-fifties)</li>
<li>Taking fertility drugs</li>
<li>A personal history of breast cancer</li>
<li>Undergoing estrogen and other hormone replacement therapy</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
                If your doctor suspects ovarian cancer, he/she may use one or a combination of methods to evaluate you, such as a transvaginal ultrasound, CT scan, barium enema X-ray, colonoscopy, MRI, PET scan, laparoscopy (pictures taken of the ovaries and other pelvic organs through a tube placed in the lower abdomen), biopsy (tissue sampling), and blood tests. (For more information on ovarian cancer screening, see Appendix C.)
