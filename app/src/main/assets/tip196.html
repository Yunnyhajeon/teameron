        A child with a headache, a stiff and/or painful neck, and fever should always be seen by a doctor immediately to rule out meningitis. 
        Early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Children with meningitis often refuse to eat and want to be left alone.

            Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain. It is most common in infants, who usually do not show specific signs 
            (see Tip 232 for additional important information on meningitis in infants). Bacterial meningitis is more serious than the viral type,
             and early diagnosis can dramatically reduce the chances of deafness, cognitive impairment, and death.

            If your child has the above symptoms, especially if they are accompanied by photophobia (sensitivity to light), he or she must be seen 
            on an emergency basis by a doctor. In the early stages of meningitis, the child may not have a stiff neck.

            Early treatment with intravenous antibiotics has a high cure rate (see Tip 3 for additional information on meningitis).

        Headaches in young children, especially when as sociated with vomiting or visual disturbances, should be taken very seriously and investigated  by a physician.

            Brain tumors are the most common type of childhood tumor. The early diagnosis of certain tumors can have a major impact on the child’s survival.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the cause of your child’s headache is a brain tumor, then the increasing pressure on the brain will cause headaches, usually in the morning, and these may be accompanied by vomit- ing and visual disturbances, most often double vision. Other symptoms may include unsteadiness during walking, slow growth in height, early puberty, seizures, or a personality change. Headaches can be caused by many non-serious conditions too, but it is important to have your child assessed and thoroughly evaluated as soon as possible.

    <div class="tip_contents">
        Adolescents or young adults who experience headaches that get progressively more severe over a few days or longer, along with visual changes, may have a rare but treatable condition in which the pressure on the brain is increased. While not usually life-threatening, it can cause serious complications such as the permanent loss of vision.

            This condition, known as benign intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri, is most common in adolescent girls. Usually the cause is unknown, but it may occasionally be the result of factors such as a hormonal imbalance, a drug side effect (for example, it could be caused by tetracycline and/or other medicines used for adolescent skin conditions), high doses of vitamin A, or obesity. Frequently no specific origin can be found.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step toward diagnosis is a brain scan, as this will help exclude other causes of increased pressure of the fluid around the brain, such as a tumor. If the scan is negative, a spinal tap can be used to detect when there is very high pressure of the fluid on the brain. This condition is important to diagnose because it may cause symptoms similar to a brain tumor but has a much better outcome. See your doctor as soon as possible for assessment and possible referral to a neurologist (brain specialist).
