            Constipation is a very common symptom in babies, and is often associated with dietary issues. Also, the bowel habits of babies are different from those of adults--babies can often go longer without a bowel movement. However, if your baby has suffered from chronic severe constipation since birth, which may have included problems with passing meconium (the dark sticky stools) at birth, he or she may have an abnormality in his/her nerve supply to the large bowel. This condition requires surgery to prevent bowel obstruction and life-threatening inflammation or perforation of the bowel. There are also other problems that may cause severe constipation, including a defective anus.

                Hirschsprung’s disease is a condition in which the nerve supply to the large bowel is abnormal. Boys are affected about five times more commonly than girls, and the disease is more frequent in children with Down’s syndrome. The symptoms depend on the length of bowel affected, which varies from a few centimeters near the anus to the entire length of the large bowel.

                If only a short segment of the bowel is involved, diagnosis may be delayed. Any baby who does not pass a stool in the first twenty-four hours of his or her life and does not have another obvious bowel problem or an anal abnormality should be investigated for this condition. Children who have been constipated since birth should also be investigated. If a diagnosis is not made quickly, the bowel may become blocked, inflamed, and could even burst (perforate). Note: It is common for a healthy toddler who has previously had normal bowel movements to experience constipation while potty training.
