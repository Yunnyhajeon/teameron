<p>
                If you observe someone acting combative or abusive after a head injury, get that person to a doctor as soon as possible, because he or she may have a significant brain injury. A helper who does not realize that this behavior is due to brain injury may think the person is drunk, taking illegal drugs, or just rude. It is very important that combative behavior be recognized as a possible red light warning signal, as it may be the only indicator of brain damage that is getting worse. (See Tip 16 for other causes of a sudden change in personality.)
