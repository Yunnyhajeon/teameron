            Fungus of the nails is often merely unsightly, but certain medications used to treat it have serious side
            effects, including liver toxicity.

                The unsightly fingernails and toenails resulting from deforming fungus infections can deal a blow to
                oneâ€™s vanity. They are ugly and keep getting uglier. Several prescription medications are highly
                effective in curing this type of infection, and they can usually do so within a few months (three months
                for fingernails and up to six months for toenails). The drawback is the potential side effects. Make
                sure that you discuss the pros and cons with your doctor before starting these medications.

                There are many non-drug-treatment options that have worked well for some people: These include daily
                soaks for fifteen minutes in a 1:1 vinegar and water solution, or daily applications of Vicks VapoRub.
                While often more time-consuming and slower acting than prescription pills, these approaches are safer.
