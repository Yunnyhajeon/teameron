            If your child experiences a head injury, is initially fine, and then becomes abnormally drowsy, vomits or develops other symptoms within hours or sometimes even days following an injury, he or she may be experiencing bleeding inside the head. This is an emergency! Any loss of consciousness, even for a short period of time, requires immediate medical evaluation.
