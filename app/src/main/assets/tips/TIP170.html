            Allergic reactions to medication commonly occur in the form of a rash or an upset stomach. Other symptoms include a low-grade fever, aching joints and muscles, and a sore mouth and tongue. Though rare, life-threatening reactions may occur.

                People can have reactions to both prescription and over-the-counter medications, including headache pills, aspirin, laxatives, and sinus pills.

                Severe allergic reactions to medications are rare, and they usually only occur immediately after starting (or restarting) a medication. In life-threatening situations associated with weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, vomiting, and/or dizziness, emergency epinephrine shots are necessary.

                A skin rash is one of the most common reactions to medication. This type of rash is generally very itchy, and its appearance will vary from patches of small red bumps to hives. It may occur anywhere on the body. It will usually not result in serious complications if the offending medication is stopped soon after the symptoms appear. Contact your doctor immediately so he/she can decide whether it is safe for you to stop the medication and start alternative treatment. Besides helping you to control the situation (and prevent future allergic reactions), he or she can also prescribe treatments to alleviate the rash.
            </p>

                However, while rashes are a common side effect, there are many other possible reactions. For example, another common one is a sore tongue or mouth. Anytime this occurs, it should be considered a reaction to a medication until proven other- wise.

                You may also experience stomach irritation in reaction to a medication. This is quite common with over-the-counter pain medicines. Make sure you notify your doctor immediately and stop the medicine, because stomach ulceration can occur and may lead to a life-threatening hemorrhage. (For more on ulcers caused by medication see Tip 100.)
            </p>

                In some cases, symptoms of an allergy to medication may be quite vague, including fatigue, a low-grade fever, and aching all over the body. It may seem like the flu, but if your condition gets worse after a week, it is time to go back to the doctor, because you may have developed a severe toxic effect from the medication.
            </p>

                Many medications can also ultimately cause a severe inflammatory reaction in the kidneys or liver, which could result in kidney failure and/or chemical hepatitis. It is prudent to be on the lookout for this phenomenon when starting a new medication. Always consult your physician immediately if you think a medication is causing any of these reactions.
            </p>

                To further protect yourself, avoid the following bad combinations of these common medications. Do not take any ibuprofen (Advil) if you are currently taking an NSAID [Daypro, Indocin, Ketoprofen, ketorolac (Toradol), meloxicam (Mobic), naprosyn (Aleve)], or if you are on blood thinners, such as Coumadin. Do not take any aspirin while taking Coumadin without first checking with your doctor. Note: In certain cases, low-dose aspirin (81 mgs) can be taken with Coumadin. In addition, review the package insert available from your pharmacist for information on side effects and drug interactions relating to all of the medications you are taking.
