            Anal pain that does not improve with common hemorrhoid treatment needs medical attention. You could have a life-threatening abscess (pus pocket) around the rectum.

<p>
                The anal area is very sensitive and can get quite painful when irritated. When severe pain occurs in this area, you will probably assume you have hemorrhoids. Most likely you will follow the basic treatment regimen of hot baths, foods or medications that soften your stools, and suppositories, expecting that the symptoms will go away. If the pain is actually caused by hemorrhoids, it will probably clear up with this treatment. But if you have formed a pus pocket (perirectal abscess), the waiting could be costly.

                This type of pus pocket is formed when germs gain entrance to the anal wall and create an infection. The infection spreads through the anal wall into an open space between the muscles in the buttocks area. In this location the infection will not show up in the form of a boil or an abscess and will not come to a head. The germs will instead spread farther upward along the wall of the rectum, the pain caused by these abscesses increasing steadily. Surgery in which the pus pocket is cut open and drained is the only treatment to stop the spreading infection.

                When you suffer from rectal pain, remember that it may not be caused by hemorrhoids. Do not allow the pain to persist too long before getting it checked by a physician.
