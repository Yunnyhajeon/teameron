            Even a mild elevation in blood pressure can put you at risk of having a heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, or heart failure.

                It is a common misconception that mild high blood pressure (hypertension) is not serious. Optimal blood pressure is 120 over 80 or less. If the upper number (the systolic blood pressure) is above 120 or the lower number (the diastolic blood pressure) is above 80, you are at a higher risk of stroke, heart disease, and kidney failure than those with lower blood pressure. Just because your blood pressure has been normal your whole life doesn’t mean you should stop having it checked. As the arteries in your body stiffen with aging, the systolic blood pressure (the top one) will continue to increase and you may need to begin taking medications. Mild to moderate elevations do not usually cause noticeable symptoms, but they are still dangerous to your health. Hypertension is known as a “silent killer.” Slight elevations such as 140 over 90 are often ignored for months or years, which may cause damage to the heart, brain, or kidneys, eventually resulting in a stroke, kidney failure, heart attack, or heart failure at an early age.

                Any elevation should be monitored with repeated blood pressure recordings. You should be evaluated by a doctor to determine the most effective therapeutic approach for controlling your blood pressure. (See Appendix C, page 380, for more detailed information about blood pressure and preventive screenings.)
