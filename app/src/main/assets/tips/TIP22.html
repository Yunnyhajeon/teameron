            If you notice that normally straight appearing lines instead look wavy or distorted (for example, when
            looking at doorways, windows, or furniture), you may have a problem with the retina of your eye that could
            lead to severe vision loss. Don’t ignore it!

                You might not notice this problem unless you check each eye separately. Your eyes work together to give
                you your best vision, so if one eye has a problem, the other eye may compensate for it, hiding this
                important warning signal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cover one eye and look directly at something with straight edges, like a desk or window. Then
                switch—cover the other eye and look at the same object. You can also do this by looking at a page of
                letters in a book. Look for straight lines that appear wavy, distorted, and/or broken. Look for a spot
                in the center of your vision that is fuzzy or darkened.

                These may be warning signs of macular degeneration, a common problem in people over age fifty. Macular
                degeneration causes a loss of central vision. It does not immediately lead to complete blindness but can
                prevent you from driving, reading, recognizing faces, and performing daily tasks.

            <p>
                If you notice any of these changes, get a dilated eye examination from an ophthalmologist (eye doctor)
                as soon as you can. The doctor may be able to treat this problem and prevent further vision loss. Early
                treatment is necessary.
