                Babies may get a condition in their bowels (called intussusception) wherein one portion of the bowel telescopes into the next and gets stuck. This blocks the bowel and cuts off the blood supply to that portion of bowel. If the condition is not reversed rapidly, the bowel will die, and the infant will become very ill.

                It may be difficult to differentiate a baby with colic (spasmodic pain in the abdomen) from one with intussusception. A baby with intussusception may spontaneously cry in regular intervals when he or she is apparently content. This pattern can be likened to the pattern of labor pains. A sausage-shaped lump may be felt in the belly, and in rare cases the baby may pass jellylike stools. If intussusception is diagnosed early, it can often be cured by a special enema, avoiding the need for surgery. This should always be done by an experienced doctor. This condition is an emergency. Get your child to an emergency room immediately.
