                If you have ever had a blood clot, you are at an increased risk of having another, no matter why you are in the hospital. Discuss this with your physician immediately upon being admitted to the hospital, since you may need anticoagulation (blood thinning) to prevent a recurrence. This treatment is called deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. Note: There are a few rare situations in which active bleeding could prohibit this strategy.

                    A previous blood clot is not the only reason that you might need a blood thinner while you are in the hospital. An immobilizing illness and prolonged bed confinement both increase your risks of getting a blood clot, whether you have had one before or not. Therefore, if your condition is serious and you are bound to your hospital bed, it might be a good idea for you to start prophylactic anticoagulation (blood-thinning medication). Another reason you might want this preventative therapy is if you are massively obese. Since massively obese people have poor circulation, they are more likely to develop blood clots.

                    The use of prophylactic anticoagulation is also extremely important after certain surgical procedures. Orthopedic procedures are at the top of this list. Almost any operation on a major bone, such as hip replacement or knee replacement, warrants anticoagulation. Discuss this with your doctor before and after your admission to the hospital, as well as before and after your operation.

                    The mortality from blood clots is quite high, so it is well worth your effort to take every possible step to prevent them. There are a number of simple measures for reducing the risk of developing blood clots, which include getting out of bed and walking around intermittently, if tolerated. There are also intermittent compression devices that your doctor may prescribe if appropriate. These are placed around the legs to squeeze and massage the calves, and thus improve circulation. (For more on blood clots, see Tips 64 and 81.)
