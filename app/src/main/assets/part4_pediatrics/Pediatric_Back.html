            If your teenager's back and ribs appear asymmetrical (especially when bending over to touch his/her toes), he/she may be developing a curved spine. It can get worse rapidly, causing serious problems.

            <p>
                Progressive curvature of the spine occurs more commonly in adolescent girls. Rapid worsening of the curvature can result in a severe deformity and breathing difficulties. Early treatment may prevent progression—surgery is occasionally needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you suspect this condition, look at your child’s back from behind while they are touching their toes. Note if the ribs on one side (in 80 percent it will be the right side) form a hump (see Figure 16), or if the shoulder blade appears to protrude on that same side. If you suspect your child has this condition, seek medical evaluation and treatment early. (See Appendix C, for information about scoliosis screening.)
