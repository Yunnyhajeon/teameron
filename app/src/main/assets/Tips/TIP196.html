            A child with a headache, a stiff and/or painful neck, and fever should always be seen by a doctor immediately to rule out meningitis. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical. Children with meningitis often refuse to eat and want to be left alone.

                Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain. It is most common in infants, who usually do not show specific signs (see Tip 232 for additional important information on meningitis in infants). Bacterial meningitis is more serious than the viral type, and early diagnosis can dramatically reduce the chances of deafness, cognitive impairment, and death.

                If your child has the above symptoms, especially if they are accompanied by photophobia (sensitivity to light), he or she must be seen on an emergency basis by a doctor. In the early stages of meningitis, the child may not have a stiff neck.

                Early treatment with intravenous antibiotics has a high cure rate (see Tip 3 for additional information on meningitis).
