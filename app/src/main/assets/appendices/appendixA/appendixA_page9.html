                from acting in an emergency situation. If you don’t try, the person’s going to die. In fact, the American Heart Association is now encouraging a “Hands-Only” approach for untrained lay people who have any hesitation about performing CPR. In the past, many people who needed CPR have died as a result of bystanders not stepping in to help for fear of acting incorrectly or because they hesitated to breathe into the mouth of a stranger. While many doctors think that the very best option is to do compressions in combination with breaths, doing compressions alone is much better than doing nothing. If you don’t feel comfortable giving breaths for any reason, then just do compressions. However, it is always very important, if at all possible, to give breaths along with compressions to children and infants.

CPR training now includes instruction relating to the use of an AED (automated external defibrillator).This is a laptop-size device that analyzes the rhythm of the heart for abnormalities and gives an electrical shock, if necessary, to the victim. Though often considered inaccessible, AEDs can be found in a surprising number of public places, such as airports, parks and recreation facilities, government and corporate facilities, and schools. Start asking people, start looking for them, so that you’ll be able to find one in an emergency situation. Using an AED is easy even for laypeople with no prior training.

There are many reasons a person can end up in a situation where he or she is unconscious, unresponsive, and not breathing, but regardless of the cause, they need CPR. Whether someone is drowning, choking, struck by lightning, having a stroke or heart attack, or suffering sudden cardiac arrest, if he or she ends up unconscious, unresponsive, and not breathing, then time is of the essence. Call 911 and begin CPR immediately. Also use an AED if readily available, or ideally get the help of a bystander to assist with the AED.

                            <li>For every minute that care is not given, the chance of survival decreases by about 10 percent.</li>
                            <li>After someone goes five to seven minutes without oxygen, brain damage usually occurs.</li>
                            <li>After ten to twelve minutes without oxygen, there is usually irreversible brain damage.</li>
                            <li>Even compressions alone are better than doing nothing, and may help the victim if you are unable or unwilling to provide breaths.</li>
