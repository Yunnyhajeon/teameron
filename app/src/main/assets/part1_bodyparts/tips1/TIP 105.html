            Mild lower belly pain or pain during sexual intercourse may be due to an infection of the female organs by a germ called chlamydia or other germs, including the gonorrhea germ. These bacteria can cause significant damage to the fallopian tubes and lead to infertility. They can also cause a life-threatening internal hemorrhage from a tubal pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy).
