            A persistent cough lasting more than two weeks may be caused by something as simple as bronchitis or
            allergies, or by something as serious as tuberculosis, pneumonia, heart disease, or cancer. An annoying
            chronic cough can also be caused by reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus (the tube between the
            mouth and the stomach). You should be evaluated as soon as possible, especially if you cough up blood, which
            may then get into the lungs.

                Everyone coughs from time to time, whether from postnasal drip, a cold, an allergy, or irritants in the
                air. Most of these minor illnesses run their course in fourteen days or less. If a cough lasts longer or
                is associated with additional symptoms, other causes must be considered by a physician. Some of these
                potential causes are life-threatening; they include lung infection, heart disease, and cancer. Smokers
                often cough constantly, so they may not realize when a more serious disease is present.

                If routine treatments for coughs have failed, and more traditional causes have been ruled out, another
                possibility is reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, which may be associated with a hiatal
                hernia. A hiatal hernia occurs when part of the stomach pokes through a hole in the diaphragm, which
                separates the chest from the abdomen. This condition can wake you up at night with the feeling that you
                are strangling. You may cough so hard that it takes your breath away, and you may even black out.

            <p>
                A hiatal hernia or other conditions can allow acid-containing fluid to back up the esophagus and then
                into the windpipe, which irritates the lining and causes repeated coughing episodes. This is called acid
                reflux. Acidic liquid is able to flow up the esophagus much more easily when you are lying down, so the
                reflux is usually more troublesome at night. If the cause of your cough is a hiatal hernia, you need to
                take medication for your stomach problem, not an antibiotic or cold medicine for your cough. It is
                important to address this problemâ€”if your lungs become soiled by acid over a long period of time,
                scarring may occur, along with a reduction in lung function.

                Treatment begins with prescription medicines designed to suppress acid formation in the stomach. Other
                practical measures are important as well. Before lying down, try to remain upright for two to four hours
                after eating or drinking. Avoid overeating at any time. Elevate the head of your bed by placing a brick
                under each leg of the headboard. This will provide enough of an incline to reduce the acid reflux yet
                not enough to disturb sleep.

                Long-term coughing may also be the result of a postnasal drip, allergies, or asthma, which need to be
                ruled out as causes by your doctor. In addition, a chronic cough may be a side effect of medication,
                including a class of blood pressure and heart medications known as ACE inhibitors. If you take one of
                these blood pressure pills and develop a cough, tell your doctor.
